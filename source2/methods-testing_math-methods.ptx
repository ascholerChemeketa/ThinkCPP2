<title>Math Methods</title>

You don't always have to write new methods to get work done.
As a reminder, the Java library contains thousands of classes you can use.
For example, the <c>Math</c> class provides common mathematical operations:
</p>

<program>
double root = Math.sqrt(17.0);
double angle = 1.5;
double height = Math.sin(angle);
</program>

<p>
The first line sets <c>root</c> to the square root of 17.
The third line finds the sine of 1.5 (the value of <c>angle</c>).
<c>Math</c> is in the <c>java.lang</c> package, so you don't have to import it.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>degrees</h></idx>
<idx><h>radians</h></idx>
<idx><h>pi</h></idx>
Values for the trigonometric functions<mdash/><c>sin</c>, <c>cos</c>, and <c>tan</c><mdash/>must be in <em>radians</em>.
To convert from degrees to radians, you divide by 180 and multiply by <m>\pi</m>.
Conveniently, the <c>Math</c> class provides a constant named <c>PI</c> that contains an approximation of <m>\pi</m>:
</p>

<program>
double degrees = 90;
double angle = degrees / 180.0 * Math.PI;
</program>

<p>
Notice that <c>PI</c> is in capital letters.
Java does not recognize <c>Pi</c>, <c>pi</c>, or <c>pie</c>.
Also, <c>PI</c> is the name of a constant, not a method, so it doesn't have parentheses.
The same is true for the constant <c>Math.E</c>, which approximates Euler's number.
</p>

<p>
Converting to and from radians is a common operation, so the <c>Math</c> class provides methods that do that for you:
</p>

<program>
double radians = Math.toRadians(180.0);
double degrees = Math.toDegrees(Math.PI);
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>long</h></idx>
<idx><h>type</h><h>long</h></idx>
Another useful method is <c>round</c>, which rounds a floating-point value to the nearest integer and returns a <c>long</c>.
The following result is 63 (rounded up from 62.8319):
</p>

<program>
long x = Math.round(Math.PI * 20.0);
</program>

<p>
A <c>long</c> is like an <c>int</c>, but bigger.
More specifically, an <c>int</c> uses 32 bits of memory; the largest value it can hold is <m>2^{31}-1</m>, which is about 2 billion.
A <c>long</c> uses 64 bits, so the largest value is <m>2^{63}-1</m>, which is about 9 quintillion.
</p>

<p>
Take a minute to read the documentation for these and other methods in the <c>Math</c> class.
The easiest way to find documentation for Java classes is to do a web search for <q>Java</q> and the name of the class.
