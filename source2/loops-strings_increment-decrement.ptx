<title>Increment and Decrement</title>
<p>
Here is another <c>while</c> loop example; this one displays the numbers 1 to 5:
</p>

<program>
int i = 1;
while (i &lt;= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;  // add 1 to i
}
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>increment</h></idx>
<idx><h>decrement</h></idx>
Assignments like <c>i = i + 1</c> don't often appear in loops, because Java provides a more concise way to add and subtract by one.
Specifically, <c>++</c> is the <em>increment</em> operator; it has the same effect as <c>i = i + 1</c>.
And <c><ndash/></c> is the <em>decrement</em> operator; it has the same effect as <c>i = i - 1</c>.
</p>

<p>
If you want to increment or decrement a variable by an amount other than <c>1</c>, you can use <c>+=</c> and <c>-=</c>.
For example, <c>i += 2</c> increments <c>i</c> by <c>2</c>:
</p>

<program>
int i = 2;
while (i &lt;= 8) {
    System.out.print(i + ", ");
    i += 2;  // add 2 to i
}
System.out.println("Who do we appreciate?");
</program>

<p>
And the output is as follows:
</p>

<console>
<output>
2, 4, 6, 8, Who do we appreciate?
</output>
</console>
