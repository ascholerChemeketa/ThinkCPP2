<title>Changes to the Second Edition</title>
<p>
This new edition was written over several years, with feedback from dozens of instructors and hundreds of students.
A complete history of all changes is available on GitHub.
Here are some of the highlights:
<ul>
<li>
<title>Chapters 1--4:</title>
<p>
We reordered the material in Chapter<nbsp/>1 to present a more interesting balance of theory and practice.
Chapters<nbsp/>2<ndash/>3 are much cleaner now too.
Methods are now presented in a single chapter, along with additional in-depth examples.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Chapters 5--8:</title>
<p>
We rearranged these chapters a lot, added many examples and new figures, and removed unnecessary details.
Strings are covered earlier (before arrays) so that readers can apply them to loop problems.
The material on recursion is now a chapter, and we added new sections to explain binary numbers and <em>CodingBat</em>.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Chapters 9--12:</title>
<p>
Our main goal for these chapters was to provide better explanations and more diagrams.
Chapters<nbsp/>9<ndash/>10 focus more on immutable versus mutable objects, and we added new sections on BigInteger and StringBuilder.
The other content is largely the same, but it should be easier to understand now.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Chapters 13--17:</title>
<p>
We balanced the amount of content in Chapters<nbsp/>13<ndash/>14 by moving ArrayLists earlier, and we implement the <q>War</q> card game as another example.
Chapters<nbsp/>15<ndash/>17 are brand new in this edition; they cover more advanced topics including 2D arrays, graphics, exceptions, abstract classes, interfaces, and events.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Appendixes:</title>
<p>
We added <xref ref="javadoc">Appendix</xref> to explain documentation comments and Javadoc in more detail. 
The other three appendixes that were present in the first edition have been revised for clarity and layout.</p></li>
</ul>
