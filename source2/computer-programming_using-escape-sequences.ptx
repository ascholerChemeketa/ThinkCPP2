<title>Using Escape Sequences</title>
<p>
It's possible to display multiple lines of output with only one line of code.
You just have to tell Java where to put the line breaks:
</p>

<listing filename="Hello3.java">
<program interactive="activecode">
public class Hello3 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello!\nHow are you doing?\n");
    }
}
</program>
</listing>

<p>
The output is two lines, each ending with a newline character:
</p>

<console>
<output>
Hello!
How are you doing?
</output>
</console>

<p>
<idx><h>escape sequence</h></idx>
Each <c>\n</c> is an <em>escape sequence</em>, or two characters of source code that represent a single character.
(The backslash allows you to <em>escape</em> the string to write special characters.)
Notice there is no space between <c>\n</c> and <c>How</c>.
If you add a space there, there will be a space at the beginning of the second line.

<p>
Java has a total of eight escape sequences, and the four most commonly used ones are listed in <xref ref="tab_escape">Table</xref>.
For example, to write quotation marks inside of strings, you need to escape them with a backslash:
</p>

<program>
System.out.println("She said \"Hello!\" to me.");
</program>

<p>
The result is as follows:
</p>

<console>
<output>
She said "Hello!" to me.
</output>
</console>
