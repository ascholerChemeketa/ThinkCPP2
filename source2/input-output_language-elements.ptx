At this point, we have seen nearly all of the organizational units that make up Java programs.
<xref ref="fig_package">Figure</xref> shows how these <q>language elements</q> are related.

Java applications are typically organized into packages (like <c>java.io</c> and <c>java.util</c>) that include multiple classes (like <c>PrintStream</c> and <c>Scanner</c>).
Each class defines its own methods (like <c>println</c> and <c>nextLine</c>), and each method is a sequence of statements.
</p>

<p>
Each statement performs one or more computations, depending on how many expressions it has, and each expression represents a single value to compute.
For example, the assignment statement <c>hours = minutes / 60.0;</c> contains a single expression: <c>minutes / 60.0</c>.
</p>

<p>
<em>Tokens</em> are the most basic elements of a program, including numbers, variable names, operators, keywords, parentheses, braces, and semicolons.
In the previous example, the tokens are <c>hours</c>, <c>=</c>, <c>minutes</c>, <c>/</c>, <c>60.0</c>, and <c>;</c> (spaces are ignored by the compiler).
</p>

<p>
Knowing this terminology is helpful, because error messages often say things like <q>not a statement</q> or <q>illegal start of expression</q> or <q>unexpected token</q>.
Comparing Java to English, statements are complete sentences, expressions are phrases, and tokens are individual words and punctuation marks.
</p>

<p>
Note there is a big difference between the Java <em>language</em>, which defines the elements in <xref ref="fig_package">Figure</xref>, and the Java <em>library</em>, which provides the built-in classes that you can import.
For example, the keywords <c>public</c> and <c>class</c> are part of the Java language, but the names <c>PrintStream</c> and <c>Scanner</c> are not.
</p>

<p>
The standard edition of Java comes with <em>several thousand</em> classes you can use, which can be both exciting and intimidating.
You can browse this library on Oracle's website (\url{https://thinkjava.org/apidoc}).
Interestingly, most of the Java library is written in Java.
