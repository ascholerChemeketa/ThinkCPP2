<title>The Philosophy Behind the Book</title>
<p>
Here are the guiding principles that make the book the way it is:
<ul>
<li>
<title>One concept at a time:</title>
<p>
We break down topics that give beginners trouble into a series of small steps, so that they can exercise each new concept in isolation before continuing.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Balance of Java and concepts:</title>
<p>
The book is not primarily about Java; it uses code examples to demonstrate computer science.
Most chapters start with language features and end with concepts.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Conciseness:</title>
<p>
An important goal of the book is to be small enough so that students can read and understand the entire text in a one-semester college or AP course.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Emphasis on vocabulary:</title>
<p>
We try to introduce the minimum number of terms and define them carefully when they are first used.
We also organize them in glossaries at the end of each chapter.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Program development:</title>
<p>
There are many strategies for writing programs, including bottom-up, top-down, and others.
We demonstrate multiple program development techniques, allowing readers to choose methods that work best for them.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Multiple learning curves:</title>
<p>
To write a program, you have to understand the algorithm, know the programming language, and be able to debug errors.
We discuss these and other aspects throughout the book and summarize our advice in <xref ref="debugging">Appendix</xref>.</p></li>
</ul>
