<title>Object-Oriented Programming</title>
<p>
Some Java books introduce classes and objects immediately; others begin with procedural programming and transition to object-oriented more gradually.
</p>

<p>
Many of Java's object-oriented features are motivated by problems with previous languages, and their implementations are influenced by this history.
Some of these features are hard to explain when people aren't familiar with the problems they solve.
</p>

<p>
We get to object-oriented programming as quickly as possible (beginning with <xref ref="immutable">Chapter</xref>).
But we introduce concepts one at a time, as clearly as possible, in a way that allows readers to practice each idea in isolation before moving on.
So it takes some time to get there.
</p>

<p>
You can't write Java programs (even Hello World) without encountering object-oriented features.
In some cases we explain a feature briefly when it first appears, and then explain it more deeply later on.

<p>
If you read the entire book, you will see nearly every topic required for Java SE Programmer I certification.
Supplemental lessons are available in the official Java tutorials on Oracle's website (\url{https://thinkjava.org/tutorial}).
</p>

<p>
This book is also well suited to prepare high school students for the AP Computer Science A exam, which includes object-oriented design and implementation.
