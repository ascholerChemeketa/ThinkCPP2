<title>The Simulation Loop</title>
<p>
At the end of <pf>main</pf>, we call <pf>mainloop</pf>, which uses a <pf>while</pf> loop to simulate the time steps of the Game of Life.
Here's a rough draft of this function:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/simulation-loop-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
During each time step, we update the state of the game and repaint the <pf>grid</pf>.
We will present the <pf>update</pf> function in <xref ref="sec_update">Section</xref>.
</p>

<p>
<pf>repaint</pf> comes from the <pf>Canvas</pf> class.
By default, it calls the <pf>paint</pf> function we provided, which calls <pf>draw</pf>.
The reason we use it here is that <pf>repaint</pf> does not require a <pf>Graphics</pf> object as a parameter.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>Thread.sleep</h></idx>
    <idx><h>sleep</h></idx>
<pf>Thread.sleep(500)</pf> causes the program to <q>sleep</q> for 500 milliseconds, or a half second.
Otherwise, the program would run so fast we would not be able to see the animation.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>InterruptedException</h></idx>
    <idx><h>exception</h><h>Interrupted</h></idx>
There's just one problem: compiling this code results in the error <q>unreported exception InterruptedException</q>.
This message means we need to do some exception handling.
