<title>Other Grid functions</title>
<p>
In addition to <pf>draw</pf> and <pf>paint</pf>, the <pf>GridCanvas</pf> class provides functions for working with the grid itself.
<pf>numRows</pf> and <pf>numCols</pf> return the number of rows and columns.
We can get this information from the 2D array, using <pf>length</pf>:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/other-grid-functions-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Because we are using row-major order, the 2D array is an array of rows.
<pf>numRows</pf> simply returns the length of the rows array.
<pf>numCols</pf> returns the length of the first row, which is the number of columns.
Since the rows all have the same length, we have to check only one.
</p>

<p>
<pf>GridCanvas</pf> also provides a function that gets the <pf>Cell</pf> at a given location, and for convenience when starting the game, a function that turns on the <pf>Cell</pf> at a given location.
