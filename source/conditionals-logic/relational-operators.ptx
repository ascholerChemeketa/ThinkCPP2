  <title>Relational Operators</title>

  <p>The most common way to produce a boolean value is by using a <term>relational operator</term> (also known as <term>comparison operator</term>) to compare two values.
    <idx>
      <h>operator</h>
      <h>relational</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>relational operator</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>comparison operator</h>
    </idx></p>

  <p>C++ has six <term>relational operators</term> that test the relationship between two values (e.g.,
    whether they are equal, or whether one is greater than the other). The following expressions
    show how they are used: </p>

  <program label="conditionals-logic_relational-operators-program-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/relational-operators-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>Each comparison represents a questions. <pf>x == y</pf> asks the question <q>does x equal y?</q>. The comparison operator decides if the answer is true or false and evaluates to that result. (Remember that an output of 1 means <pf>true</pf> and 0 means <pf>false</pf>.) In many ways, the <pf>==</pf> in <pf>x == y</pf> is similar to <pf>+</pf> in <pf>x + y</pf>. They both are operators that use two operands (x and y here) and calculate an answer based on them.</p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>automatic conversion</h>
    </idx> The two sides of a relational operator have to be
    compatible. For example, the expression <pf>5 &lt; "6"</pf> is invalid because <pf>5</pf> is an <pf>int</pf> and <pf>"6"</pf>
    is a <pf>string</pf>. When comparing values of different numeric types, C++ applies the same conversion
    rules you saw previously with the assignment operator. For example, when evaluating the
    expression <pf>5 &lt; 6.2</pf>, C++ automatically converts the <pf>5</pf> to <pf>5.0</pf>.</p>

  <p>
    Since relational operators evaluate to a <pf>boolean</pf>
    value, you can store the result of a comparison into a <pf>bool</pf> variable: </p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/boolevariables-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>flag</h>
    </idx> The parentheses are unnecessary, but they make the code easier to
    understand. A variable defined in this way is called a <term>flag</term>, because it signals, or <q>
    flags</q>, the presence or absence of a condition. </p>
