<title>Logical Operators</title>
<p>
    <idx><h>logical operator</h></idx>
    <idx><h>operator</h><h>logical</h></idx>
    <idx><h>and operator</h></idx>
    <idx><h>or operator</h></idx>
    <idx><h>not operator</h></idx>
In addition to the relational operators, Java also has three <term>logical operators</term>: <c>ANDAND</c>, <c>||</c>, and <c>!</c>, which respectively stand for <term>and</term>, <term>or</term>, and <term>not</term>.
The results of these operators are similar to their meanings in English.
For example:
<ul>
<li><p><c>x MORE 0 ANDAND x LESS 10</c> is true when <c>x</c> is greater than 0 <term>and</term> less than 10.</p></li>
<li><p><c>x LESS 0 || x MORE 10</c> is true if either condition is true; that is, if <c>x</c> is less than 0 <term>or</term> greater than 10.</p></li>
<li><p><c>!(x MORE 0)</c> is true if <c>x</c> is <term>not</term> greater than 0.
The parentheses are necessary in this example because, in the order of operations, <c>!</c> comes before <c>MORE</c>.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In order for an expression with <c>ANDAND</c> to be true, both sides of the <c>ANDAND</c> operator must be true.
And in order for an expression with <c>||</c> to be false, both sides of the <c>||</c> operator must be false.
</p>

<p>
The <c>ANDAND</c> operator can be used to simplify nested <c>if</c> statements.
For example, the following code can be rewritten with a single condition:
</p>

<program xml:id="conditionals-logic_logical-operators-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/logical-operators-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  
<program xml:id="conditionals-logic_logical-operators-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/logical-operators-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Likewise, the <c>||</c> operator can simplify chained <c>if</c> statements.
Since the branches are the same, there is no need to duplicate that code:
</p>

<program xml:id="conditionals-logic_logical-operators-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/logical-operators-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  
<program xml:id="conditionals-logic_logical-operators-4">
<xi:include href="../../programs/conditionals-logic/logical-operators-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Then again, if the statements in the branches were different, we could not combine them into one block.
But it's useful to explore different ways of representing the same logic, especially when it's complex.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>short circuit</h></idx> Logical operators evaluate the second expression <term>only when necessary</term>.
For example, <c>true || anything</c> is always true, so Java does not need to evaluate the expression <c>anything</c>.
Likewise, <c>false ANDAND anything</c> is always false.
</p>

<p>
Ignoring the second operand, when possible, is called <term>short-circuit</term> evaluation, by analogy with an electrical circuit.
Short-circuit evaluation can save time, especially if <c>anything</c> takes a long time to evaluate.
It can also avoid unnecessary errors, if <c>anything</c> might fail.
