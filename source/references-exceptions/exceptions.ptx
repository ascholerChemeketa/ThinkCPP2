  <title>Exceptions</title>

  <p><term>Exceptions</term> are a programming convention that allows a low-level function to communicate <q>there was an error</q> to higher-level code that gets around some of the complications of other strategies.<idx><h>exception</h></idx>.</p>

  <p>When a function generates an exception, we say that it <term>throws</term> that exception. The thrown exception travels back up the call stack one function at a time, giving each higher-level function a chance to <term>catch</term> the exception.<idx><h>throw</h></idx><idx><h>catch</h></idx>. If nothing catches the exception, the program will be stopped.</p>

  <p>To start exploring exceptions, we will use a familiar string function. When `substr` is given a bad index it responds by throwing an exception. Try running this sample that ends up asking for a substring starting at index 50 in a much shorter string:</p>

  <program xml:id="references-exceptions_exceptions-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/references-exceptions/exceptions-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>If you run that code, you should get an error like:</p>

  <console>
  <output>
  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  </output>
  </console>

  <p>An `out_of_range` exception was thrown by the attempt on line 80 to get the substring. Because the exception was not caught, the program was terminated.</p>

  <p>Let's try catching the exception in `mediumJob`. To catch an exception, we use this syntax:</p>
  
<program>
  try {
    // code that might throw an exception
  } catch (const exception&amp; e) {
    // code to handle the exception
  }
</program>

  <p>`exception` is a data type defined in the `&lt;exception>` library. `catch(const exception&amp; e)` says that the variable `e` is going to be a const reference to an `exception` that is coming from somewhere else. Let's add that to our program to catch the exception that is coming from `substr`:</p>

  <program xml:id="references-exceptions_exceptions-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/references-exceptions/exceptions-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>This time, we caught the exception. The exception happens on line 10. As soon as it happens, execution jumps to the `catch`. Line 11 never runs. Which is good, as there is no result from line 10 that it can use. Inside the catch, line 14 runs and prints a message. `e.what()` results in a string that describes the exception. The code then recovers from the error by setting the `mediumResult` variable to a default value (`"mediumJob(?)"`).</p>

  <p>That result is returned to `bigJob` in the normal manner and the program continues on as if nothing bad happened.</p>

  <note>
    <p>Every `try` MUST have a catch.</p>
    <p>Execution in a `try` stops if an exception occurs, the rest of the try block will not get a chance to run.</p>
