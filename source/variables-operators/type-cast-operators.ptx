  <title>Type Casting</title>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, C++ converts <c>int</c>'s to <c>double</c>'s automatically if necessary, because
    no information is lost in the translation. On the other hand, going from a <c>double</c> to an <c>int</c>
    requires truncating the value. Compilers will issue a warning something like: <q>incompatible
    types: possible lossy conversion from double to int</q>.</p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>typecast</h>
    </idx>To remove this warning, you can do a <term>typecast</term>.
    Typecasting is so called because it allows you to take a value that belongs to one type and <q>
    cast</q> it into another type (in the sense of molding or reforming, not throwing).</p>

  <p><idx>
      <h>explicit conversion</h>
    </idx>
  <idx>
      <h>cast</h>
      <h>explicit</h>
    </idx>In C++, the way ask the compiler to do a typecast is to write <c>static_cast&lt;TYPE&gt;(VALUE)</c>.
    When you write that, you are essentially saying <q>I know this looks potentially dangerous, but
    please go ahead and convert VALUE to type TYPE and do not warn me about it.</q> This is known as
    an <term>explicit conversion</term> because you are explicitly (visibly) doing the cast. Here is
    an example of an explicit conversion of a double value to the int type:</p>

  <program xml:id="variables-operators_type-cast-operators-2"
           line-numbers="yes">
<xi:include href="../../programs/variables-operators/type-cast-operators-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>Note that the <c>static_cast</c> does not change the value of the variable <c>pi</c>. it makes a copy of the
    value and converts it to the new type (<c>int</c>). The result is exactly the same as if we wrote <c>int x = pi;</c>
    on line 9 except there is no warning!</p>

  <p>It is possible to type cast an integer value into a double. Normally, it is not necessary to do
    so as the compiler will implicitly do the conversion without complaining. But sometimes it is
    useful to cast an integer to a double in order to force floating-point math. The following
    example does this to get a decimal answer for 1/3 in the second line of output:</p>

  <program xml:id="variables-operators_type-cast-operators-2"
           line-numbers="yes">
<xi:include href="../../programs/variables-operators/type-cast-operators-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>As the line is evaluated, the <c>static_cast</c> happens first. It converts <c>1</c> to <c>1.0</c>. Then the
    division takes place and it now says <c>1.0 / 3</c>. Since there is at least one floating-point value
    involved, C++ does floating-point math.</p>

  <insight>
    <p>A <c>static_cast</c> does a conversion the compiler already knows how to do but would normally either
      not do or issue a warning for.</p>
  </insight>

  <note>
    <p>In C programming, you cast by writing something like <c>int x = (int)pi;</c>. Although C-style casts can also
      be written in C++, you should avoid using them.</p>

  <exercise label="double_to_int_2">
    <statement>
      <p>Your final grade consists of your average performance on exam 1 and exam 2.
        Your professor is using C++ to grade the exams and allows you to choose which
        method you'd like your exam to be graded.</p>
      <program>
double exam1 = 88.8;
double exam2 = 72.7;
</program>
      <p>
        <term>Method 1:</term>
      </p>
      <program>
double final = (static_cast&lt;int&gt;(exam1) + static_cast&lt;int&gt;(exam2)) / 2;
</program>
      <p>
        <term>Method 2:</term>
      </p>
      <program>

    <choices>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p><term>Method 1:</term><c>final</c> is a <c>double</c>, meaning my final grade will have more
            digits past the decimal, and will be higher than the <c>int</c> in Method 2.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          Although <c>final</c> is a <c>double</c>, it doesn't have any digits past the decimal due to the
            integer division.

      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p><term>Method 1:</term> the rounding happens at the beginning, so both test
            scores will be rounded to the nearest <c>int</c>, which in my case, will round all of them
            up.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          Converting to an <c>int</c> always rounds <em>towards 0</em>, even if your <c>double</c> is very
            close to the next integer.
