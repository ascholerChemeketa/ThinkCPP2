<title>Aliasing Revisited</title>
<p>
    <idx><h>reference</h></idx>
Remember that when you assign an object to a variable, you are assigning a <term>reference</term> to an object.
It is possible to have multiple variables that refer to the same object.
For example, this code creates two variables that refer to the same <pf>Rectangle</pf>:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/mutable-objects/aliasing-revisited-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<xref ref="fig_aliasing">Figure</xref> shows the result: <pf>box1</pf> and <pf>box2</pf> refer to the same object, so any changes that affect one variable also affect the other.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_aliasing" >
<caption>Memory diagram showing two variables that refer to the same <pf>Rectangle</pf> object.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/aliasing.png" />
</figure>
<p>
For example, the following code uses <pf>grow</pf> to make <pf>box1</pf> bigger by 50 units in all directions.
It decreases <pf>x</pf> and <pf>y</pf> by 50, and it increases <pf>height</pf> and <pf>width</pf> by 100:
</p>

<program label="mutable-objects_aliasing-revisited-program-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/mutable-objects/aliasing-revisited-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The result is shown in <xref ref="fig_aliasing2">Figure</xref>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_aliasing2" >
<caption>Memory diagram showing the effect of invoking <pf>grow</pf>.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/aliasing2.png" />
</figure>
<p>
Now, if we print <pf>box1</pf>, we are not surprised to see that it has changed:
</p>

<program label="mutable-objects_aliasing-revisited-program-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/mutable-objects/aliasing-revisited-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
And if we print <pf>box2</pf>, we should not be surprised to see that it has changed too, because it refers to the same object:
</p>

<program label="mutable-objects_aliasing-revisited-program-3" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/mutable-objects/aliasing-revisited-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>aliasing</h></idx>
This scenario is called <q>aliasing</q> because a single object has multiple names, or aliases, that refer to it.
</p>

<p>
As you can tell from this simple example, code that involves aliasing can get confusing fast, and it can be difficult to debug.
