<title>Rounding Errors</title>
<p>
Most floating-point numbers are only <em>approximately</em> correct.
Some numbers, like reasonably sized integers, can be represented exactly.
But repeating fractions, like <m>1/3</m>, and irrational numbers, like <m>\pi</m>, cannot.
To represent these numbers, computers have to round off to the nearest floating-point number.

<idx><h>rounding error</h></idx>
<idx><h>error</h><h>rounding</h></idx>
The difference between the number we want and the floating-point number we get is called <em>rounding error</em>.
For example, the following two statements should be equivalent:
</p>

<program xml:id="variables-operators_rounding-errors-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/variables-operators_rounding-errors-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
But on many machines, the output is as follows:
</p>

<console>
<output>
1.0
0.9999999999999999
</output>
</console>

<p>
The problem is that <c>0.1</c> is a repeating fraction when converted into binary.
So its floating-point representation stored in memory is only approximate.
When we add up the approximations, the rounding errors accumulate.
</p>

<p>
For many applications (like computer graphics, encryption, statistical analysis, and multimedia rendering), floating-point arithmetic has benefits that outweigh the costs.
But if you need <em>absolute</em> precision, use integers instead.
For example, consider a bank account with a balance of $123.45:
</p>

<program xml:id="variables-operators_rounding-errors-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/variables-operators_rounding-errors-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
In this example, balances will become inaccurate over time as the variable is used in arithmetic operations like deposits and withdrawals.
The result would be angry customers and potential lawsuits.
You can avoid the problem by representing the balance as an integer:
</p>

<program xml:id="variables-operators_rounding-errors-3" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/variables-operators_rounding-errors-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>type</h><h>long</h></idx>
This solution works as long as the number of cents doesn't exceed the largest <c>int</c>, which is about 2 billion.
