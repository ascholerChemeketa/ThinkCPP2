<title>The Scanner Bug</title>
<p>
Now that you've had some experience with <c>Scanner</c>, we want to warn you about an unexpected behavior.
The following code fragment asks users for their name and age:
</p>

<program xml:id="input-output_scanner-bug-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/scanner-bug-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The output might look something like this:
</p>

<console>
<output>
Hello Grace Hopper, age 45
</output>
</console>

<p>
When you read a <c>String</c> followed by an <c>int</c>, everything works just fine.
But when you read an <c>int</c> followed by a <c>String</c>, something strange happens:
</p>

<program xml:id="input-output_scanner-bug-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/scanner-bug-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Try running this example code.
It doesn't let you input your name, and it immediately displays the output:
</p>

<console>
<output>
What is your name? Hello , age 45
</output>
</console>

<p>
To understand what is happening, you need to realize that <c>Scanner</c> doesn't see input as multiple lines as we do.
Instead, it gets a <term>stream of characters</term> as shown in <xref ref="fig_hopper1">Figure</xref>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_hopper1" >
<caption>A stream of characters as seen by a <c>Scanner</c>.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/hopper1.png" />
</figure>
<p>
    <idx><h>state</h></idx>
The arrow indicates the next character to be read by <c>Scanner</c>.
When you run <c>nextInt</c>, it reads characters until it gets to a non-digit.
<xref ref="fig_hopper2">Figure</xref> shows the state of the stream after <c>nextInt</c> runs.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_hopper2" >
<caption>A stream of characters after <c>nextInt</c> runs.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="images/hopper2.png" />
</figure>
<p>
At this point, <c>nextInt</c> returns the value <c>45</c>.
The program then displays the prompt <c>"What is your name? "</c> and runs <c>nextLine</c>, which reads characters until it gets to a newline.
But since the next character is already a newline, <c>nextLine</c> returns the empty string <c>""</c>.
</p>

<p>
To solve this problem, you need an extra <c>nextLine</c> after <c>nextInt</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="input-output_scanner-bug-3" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/scanner-bug-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
This technique is common when reading <c>int</c> or <c>double</c> values that appear on their own line.
First you read the number, and then you read the rest of the line, which is just a newline character.
