  <title>String Streams</title>

  <p>One final kind of stream is worth discussion: the `stringstream`. This is a stream that reads from or writes to a string. It can be used as an alternative to `std::format` for building up a string with data from variables. It also can be used to imitate writing to a file. If we want to test out code that is supposed to write to a file, we can instead have it write to a `stringstream` and then print out the string that was produced. If the output looks good, we know that if we successfully open a file and write to that instead of the `stringstream`, our program should work correctly.</p>

  <p>The `stringstream` data type is defined in the `&lt;sstream>` library. Once we create a variable of type `stringstream` we can then immediately write to it using `&lt;&lt;` (there is no file to open). Once we are done writing, we can use the `.str()` method to ask the string stream for the string that was built up:</p>

  <program label="input-output_string-streams-1"  interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/string-streams-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>It is also possible to read from a string stream. This is done by using the `.str()` method to set the string that we want to read from. Once we have set the string, we can use `>>` to read from it just like we would from a file or the console:</p>

  <program label="input-output_string-streams-2"  interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/string-streams-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>Notice that everything after setting up the stringstream looks just like reading from a file. We even still use `eof()` even though there isn't really a file that we are reading from - when working with a `stringstream`, `eof()` means <q>end of the stringstream</q>.</p>
