<title>Inheritance</title>
<p>
At this point, we have a class that represents a collection of cards.
It provides functionality common to decks of cards, piles of cards, hands of cards, and potentially other collections.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>inheritance</h></idx>
    <idx><h>subclass</h></idx>
    <idx><h>extends</h></idx>
However, each kind of collection will be slightly different.
Rather than add every possible feature to <c>CardCollection</c>, we can use <term>inheritance</term> to define subclasses.
A <term>subclass</term> is a class that <q>extends</q> an existing class; that is, it has the attributes and functions of the existing class, plus more.
</p>

<p>
Here is the complete definition of our new and improved <c>Deck</c> class:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_inheritance-1">
<xi:include href="../programs/extending-classes_inheritance-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>extends</h></idx>
    <idx><h>superclass</h></idx>
The first line uses the keyword <c>extends</c> to indicate that <c>Deck</c> extends the class <c>CardCollection</c>.
That means a <c>Deck</c> object has the same instance variables and functions as a <c>CardCollection</c>.
Another way to say the same thing is that <c>Deck</c> <q>inherits from</q> <c>CardCollection</c>.
We could also say that <c>CardCollection</c> is a <term>superclass</term>, and <c>Deck</c> is one of its subclasses.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>Object class</h></idx>
In Java, classes may extend only one superclass.
Classes that do not specify a superclass with <c>extends</c> automatically inherit from <c>java.lang.Object</c>.
So in this example, <c>Deck</c> extends <c>CardCollection</c>, which in turn extends <c>Object</c>.
The <c>Object</c> class provides the default <c>equals</c> and <c>toString</c> functions, among other things.
</p>

<p>
Constructors are <term>not</term> inherited, but all other <c>public</c> attributes and functions are.
The only additional function in <c>Deck</c>, at least for now, is a constructor.
So you can create a <c>Deck</c> object like this:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_inheritance-2">
<xi:include href="../programs/extending-classes_inheritance-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The first line of the constructor uses <c>super</c>, which is a keyword that refers to the superclass of the current class.
When <c>super</c> is used as a function, as in this example, it invokes the constructor of the superclass.
</p>

<p>
So in this case, <c>super</c> invokes the <c>CardCollection</c> constructor, which initializes the attributes <c>label</c> and <c>cards</c>.
When it returns, the <c>Deck</c> constructor resumes and populates the (empty) <c>ArrayList</c> with <c>Card</c> objects.
</p>

<p>
That's it for the <c>Deck</c> class.
Next we need a way to represent a hand, which is the collection of cards held by a player, and a pile, which is a collection of cards on the table.
We could define two classes, one for hands and one for piles, but there is not much difference between them.
So we'll use one class, called <c>Hand</c>, for both hands and piles.
Here's what the definition looks like:
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>Hand</h></idx>
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_inheritance-3">
<xi:include href="../programs/extending-classes_inheritance-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Like <c>Deck</c>, the <c>Hand</c> class extends <c>CardCollection</c>.
So it inherits functions like <c>getLabel</c>, <c>size</c>, and <c>getCard</c>, which are used in <c>display</c>.
<c>Hand</c> also provides a constructor, which invokes the constructor of <c>CardCollection</c>.
</p>

<p>
In summary, a <c>Deck</c> is just like a <c>CardCollection</c>, but it provides a different constructor.
And a <c>Hand</c> is just like a <c>CardCollection</c>, but it provides an additional function, <c>display</c>.
</p>
