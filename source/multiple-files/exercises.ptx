    <statement>
      <p>In the development environment of your choice, set up a multiple file project. It should consist of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A .cpp file that has a simple function like <pf>int countSpaces(const string&amp; text);</pf>.</li>
        <li>A .h file that declares that function.</li>
        <li>A second .cpp file with a <pf>main</pf> function that uses that function and includes the .h file.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Make sure you can:
        <ul>
          <li>Compile (but not link) each .cpp file on its own.</li>
          <li>Build the full program by compiling and linking all .cpp files together.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <statement>
      <p>In the development environment of your choice, set up a multiple file project. It should consist of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A .cxx file that exports a module called <pf>CountSpaces</pf>. It should define and export a function called <pf>int countSpaces(const string&amp; text);</pf>.</li>
        <li>A second .cpp file with a <pf>main</pf> function that uses that function and imports the <pf>CountSpaces</pf> module.</li>
      </ul>
