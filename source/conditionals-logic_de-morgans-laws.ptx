<title>De Morgan's Laws</title>
<p>
Sometimes you need to negate an expression containing a mix of relational and logical operators.
For example, to test if <c>x</c> and <c>y</c> are both nonzero, you could write the following:
</p>

<program xml:id="conditionals-logic_de-morgans-laws-1">
<xi:include href="../programs/conditionals-logic_de-morgans-laws-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>De Morgan's laws</h></idx>
This condition is difficult to read because of the <c>!</c> and parentheses.
A better way to negate logic expressions is to apply <term>De Morgan's laws</term>:
<ul>
<li><p><c>!(A ANDAND B)</c> <nbsp/>is the same as<nbsp/> <c>!A || !B</c></p></li>
<li><p><c>!(A || B)</c> <nbsp/>is the same as<nbsp/> <c>!A ANDAND !B</c></p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In words, negating a logical expression is the same as negating each term and changing the operator.
The <c>!</c> operator takes precedence over <c>ANDAND</c> and <c>||</c>, so you don't have to put parentheses around the individual terms <c>!A</c> and <c>!B</c>.
</p>

<p>
De Morgan's laws also apply to the relational operators.
In this case, negating each term means using the <q>opposite</q> relational operator:
<ul>
<li><p><c>!(x LESS 5 ANDAND y == 3)</c> <nbsp/>is the same as<nbsp/> <c>x MORE= 5 || y != 3</c></p></li>
<li><p><c>!(x MORE= 1 || y != 7)</c> <nbsp/>is the same as<nbsp/> <c>x LESS 1 ANDAND y == 7</c></p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
It may help to read these examples out loud in English.
For instance, <q>If I don't want the case where <m>x</m> is less than 5 and <m>y</m> is 3, then I need <m>x</m> to be greater than or equal to 5, or I need <m>y</m> to be anything but 3.</q>
</p>

<p>
Returning to the previous example, here is the revised condition.
In English, it reads, <q>If <m>x</m> is not zero and <m>y</m> is not zero.</q>
The logic is the same, and the source code is easier to read:
</p>

<program xml:id="conditionals-logic_de-morgans-laws-2">
<xi:include href="../programs/conditionals-logic_de-morgans-laws-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
