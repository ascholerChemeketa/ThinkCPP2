<title>Testing with JUnit</title>
<p>
    <idx><h>unit test</h></idx>
When beginners start writing functions, they usually test them by invoking them from <pf>main</pf> and checking the results by hand.
For example, to test <pf>fibonacci</pf> from <xref ref="fibonacci">Section</xref>, we could write this:
</p>

<program label="tools_testing-with-junit-program-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/tools/testing-with-junit-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
This test code is self-explanatory, but it's longer than it needs to be, and it doesn't scale very well.
In addition, the error messages provide limited information.
For cases where we know the right answer, we can do better by writing <term>unit tests</term>.
</p>

<p>
JUnit (<url href="https://junit.org/"/>) is a common testing tool for Java programs.
To use it, you have to create a test class that contains test functions.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose that the <pf>fibonacci</pf> function belongs to a class named <pf>Series</pf>.
Here is a corresponding JUnit<fn>This code is based on JUnit 3, which has been superseded but is the default version supported by DrJava.</fn> test class and test function:
</p>

<program label="tools_testing-with-junit-program-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/tools/testing-with-junit-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
This example uses the keyword <pf>extends</pf>, which indicates that the new class, <pf>SeriesTest</pf>, is based on an existing class, <pf>TestCase</pf>.
The <pf>TestCase</pf> class is imported from the package <pf>junit.framework</pf>.
</p>

<p>
The names in this example follow convention: if the name of your class is <pf>Something</pf>, the name of the test class should be <pf>SomethingTest</pf>.
And if there is a function in <pf>Something</pf> named <pf>somefunction</pf>, there should be a function in <pf>SomethingTest</pf> named <pf>testSomefunction</pf>.
</p>

<p>
Many development environments can generate test classes and test functions automatically.
In DrJava, you can select <term>New JUnit Test Case</term> from the <term>File</term> menu to generate an empty test class.
</p>

<p>
<pf>assertEquals</pf> is provided by the <pf>TestCase</pf> class.
It takes two arguments and checks whether they are equal.
If so, it does nothing; otherwise, it displays a detailed error message.
The first argument is the <term>expected value</term>, which we consider correct, and the second argument is the <term>actual value</term> we want to check.
If they are not equal, the test fails.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>System.err</h></idx>
Using <pf>assertEquals</pf> is more concise than writing your own <pf>if</pf> statements and <pf>System.err</pf> messages.
JUnit provides additional assert functions, such as <pf>assertNull</pf>, <pf>assertSame</pf>, and <pf>assertTrue</pf>, which can be used to design a variety of tests.
</p>

<p>
To run JUnit directly from DrJava, click the <term>Test</term> button on the toolbar.
If all your test functions pass, you will see a green bar in the lower-right corner.
Otherwise, DrJava will take you directly to the first assertion that failed.
