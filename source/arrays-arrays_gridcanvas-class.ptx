<title>The GridCanvas Class</title>
<p>
Now that we have a <c>Cell</c> class and a way to represent a 2D array of cells, we can write a class to represent a grid of cells.
We encapsulate the code from the previous section and generalize it to construct a grid with any number of rows and columns:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-1">
<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>IS-A</h></idx>
<idx><h>HAS-A</h></idx>
<idx><h>Graphics</h></idx>
Using vocabulary from the previous chapter, <c>GridCanvas</c> <q>is<nbsp/>a</q> <c>Canvas</c> that <q>has<nbsp/>a</q> 2D array of cells.
By extending the <c>Canvas</c> class from <c>java.awt</c>, we inherit methods for drawing graphics on the screen.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>nested</h><h>arrays</h></idx>
<idx><h>traversal</h></idx>
In fact, the code is surprisingly straightforward: to draw the grid, we simply draw each cell.
We use nested <c>for</c> loops to traverse the 2D array:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-2">
<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The outer loop traverses the rows; the inner loop traverses the cells in each row.
You can almost read this method in English: <q>For each <c>row</c> in the <c>array</c>, and for each <c>cell</c> in the <c>row</c>, draw the <c>cell</c> in the graphics context.</q>
Each cell contains its coordinates and size, so it knows how to draw itself.
</p>

<p>
Classes that extend <c>Canvas</c> are supposed to provide a method called <c>paint</c> that <q>paints</q> the contents of the <c>Canvas</c>.
It gets invoked when the <c>Canvas</c> is created and anytime it needs to be redrawn; for example, when its window is moved or resized.
</p>

<p>
Here's the <c>paint</c> method for <c>GridCanvas</c>.
When the window management system calls <c>paint</c>, <c>paint</c> calls <c>draw</c>, which draws the cells:

<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
