<title>Class Variables</title>
<p>
<idx><h>class variable</h></idx>
So far you have seen local variables, which are declared inside a function, and instance variables, which are declared in a class definition, usually before the function definitions.
Now it's time to learn about <term>class variables</term>.
They are shared across all instances of the class.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>static</h></idx>
<idx><h>variable</h><h>static</h></idx>
Like instance variables, class variables are defined in a class definition, before the function definitions.
But they are identified by the keyword <c>static</c>.
Here is a version of <c>Card</c> in which <c>RANKS</c> and <c>SUITS</c> are defined as class variables:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-objects_class-variables-1">
<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-objects_class-variables-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>garbage collection</h></idx>
Class variables are allocated when the program begins and persist until the program ends.
In contrast, instance variables like <c>rank</c> and <c>suit</c> are allocated when the program creates <c>new</c> objects, and they are deleted when the object is garbage-collected (see <xref ref="garbage">Section</xref>).
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>final</h></idx>
Class variables are often used to store constant values that are needed in several places.
In that case, they should also be declared as <c>final</c>.
Note that whether a variable is <c>static</c> or <c>final</c> involves two separate considerations:
<c>static</c> means the variable is <term>shared</term>, and <c>final</c> means the variable (or in this case, the reference) is <term>constant</term>.
</p>

<p>
Naming <c>static final</c> variables with capital letters is a common convention that makes it easier to recognize their role in the class.
In the <c>toString</c> function, we refer to <c>SUITS</c> and <c>RANKS</c> as if they were local variables, but we can tell that they are class variables.
</p>

<p>
One advantage of defining <c>SUITS</c> and <c>RANKS</c> as class variables is that they don't need to be created (and garbage-collected) every time <c>toString</c> is called.
They may also be needed in other functions and classes, so it's helpful to make them available everywhere.
