  <title>Function Design and Program Development</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>We have been using and writing functions for a while. However, up until now we haven't been doing the design of those functions - we have been focusing on how to write a function that is already specified.</p>

    <p>In this chapter, we focus on developing a slightly more complex programs by designing and building multiple functions. We will also explore how to break our code up into multiple files to facilitate code reuse.</p>

<!-- TODO - what else is in here?-->
