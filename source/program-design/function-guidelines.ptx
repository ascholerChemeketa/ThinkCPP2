  <title>Function Guidelines</title>

  <p>Any kind of design is subjective and as much an art as a science. Design problems often have
    multiple solutions, and there is no single <q>right</q> solution. Different goals of a design
    problem will often be at odds with each other, and different solutions will have different
    trade-offs.</p>

  <p>If we are designing a car, we might want it to be fast, comfortable, and fuel-efficient.
    However, these goals are often in conflict with each other. A car that is fast may need to be
    low and aerodynamic, which may make it less comfortable. An engine designed to generate more
    power may be less fuel-efficient. Good design is about deciding which goals are most important
    and making trade-offs accordingly. The design for a SUV that will be marketed to families will
    prioritize comfort and safety over speed and efficiency. The design for a sports car will
    prioritize performance and might </p>

  <p>For any design domain, we can try to identify design guidelines that should shape our approach.
    A car design guideline might be <q>start from an egg-like shape</q>. That is a very aerodynamic
    shape, so following it will likely improve both performance and fuel-efficiency. This guideline
    is not an absolute rule. For a particular car design, we might need to ignore that guideline to
    satisfy some other important goal. However, absent a clear reason to ignore the guideline, our
    design will likely benefit from following it.</p>

  <p>Function design offers room for similar tradeoffs. For example, a design that allows a function
    to be reused in many different contexts may require it to be more complex, which can make it
    harder to understand (a less good abstraction). Or a function that is very efficient may be
    difficult to read and maintain. Our goal is to maximize some combination of the following
    factors: <ul>
      <li>The clarity of the code (the abstraction of the function)</li>
      <li>The reusability of the code (how much it avoids repeating code)</li>
      <li>The modularity of the code (how easy it is to work on one part at a time)</li>
      <li>The efficiency of the code (how efficiently it performs its task)</li>
    </ul> Of those,
    efficiency will be the one that we worry about the least for now. If a design is clear,
    reusable, and modular, it will likely be efficient enough for most purposes. If it is not
    efficient enough, we can often optimize it later. Once you begin studying algorithms and data
    structures, we will have more tools at our disposal for improving efficiency.</p>

  <p>Here are some guidelines that we can follow to help us achieve those goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Functions should have a <term>single responsibility</term>. A function should do one thing
        and do it well. If a function is trying to do too many things, it often becomes more complex
        and difficult to maintain. And, it ends up being harder to reuse in situations that only
        call for part of its functionality.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Functions should be <term>modular</term>. A function should be self-contained and not
        depend on the state of the rest of the program. This makes it easier to test and reuse the
        function in different contexts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Functions should be <term>small</term>. A function that is too large is difficult to
        understand and maintain. <q>Too large</q> is a loosely defined term. The real goal is to
        avoid programmers having to keep too much information in their head at once. But a good rule
        of thumb is to keep functions under 10-15 lines of code when possible. If a function starts
        getting larger than that, it is time to take a look at breaking it up into smaller
        functions.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
