<title>Returning</title>



  <note><p>It can help to think of there being two programmers involved in writing code involving a function. Imagine there is one programmer who writes the function. They don't know anything about what is going on in the rest of the program. There is another programmer who is using the function. They don't know anything about what happens inside the function (other than the information they are passing in and what should come back).</p></note>
