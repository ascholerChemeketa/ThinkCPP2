  <title>Exception Throwing</title>

  <p>When using exceptions, code that detects a problem which it cannot handle should <pf>throw</pf> an exception. You can do so by using the <pf>throw</pf> keyword followed by what you want to throw. Although you can thrown anything (an int, string, etc...). It is generally best to throw some type of <pf>exception</pf>.</p>

  <p><pf>exception</pf> itself is what is known as an <term>abstract</term> data type. It is a type that describes many more specific types, but nothing is just an <pf>exception</pf>. (Similar to <q>animal</q>. <q>animal</q> describes many different types of creature, but nothing is just an <q>animal</q>. Each particular animal is a dog, or a cat, or a horse.)</p>

  <p>Thus we need to throw something more specific like a <pf>logic_error</pf>. To do that, we say <pf>throw logic_error(STRING);</pf>. The <pf>STRING</pf> should be a string that describes what went wrong. <pf>logic_error</pf> is from the <pf>&lt;stdexcept></pf> library, so we also need to include it. This sample shows mediumJob throwing a <pf>logic_error</pf>:</p>

  <program label="program-design_exceptions-throwing-program-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/program-design/exceptions-throwing-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>In this version of the program, the author of <pf>mediumJob</pf> wrote logic to check for the conditions that would lead to an error. If things do not look good, the function throws the exception (line 10). This ends execution of <pf>mediumJob</pf> and immediately jumps back to <pf>bigJob</pf> to see if the exception is caught there.</p>

  <note><p>One a function throws an exception, no more code will run and no value will be returned via any <pf>return</pf> statements. A <pf>throw</pf> represents a function completely giving up on its job.</p></note>

  <insight><p><pf>logic_error</pf> is a good catchall for <q>something does not make sense here</q>. There may be times when some other type of exception makes more sense, but we will generally just throw a <pf>logic_error</pf> when throwing exceptions in this book.</p></insight>
