  <title>Exceptions</title>

  <p><term>Exceptions</term> are a programming convention that allows a low-level function to communicate <q>there was an error</q> to higher-level code that gets around some of the complications of other strategies.<idx><h>exception</h></idx>.</p>

  <p>When a function generates an exception, we say that it <term>throws</term> that exception. The thrown exception travels back up the call stack one function at a time, giving each higher-level function a chance to <term>catch</term> the exception.<idx><h>throw</h></idx><idx><h>catch</h></idx>. If nothing catches the exception, the program will be stopped.</p>

  <p>To start exploring exceptions, we will look at a string function that throws exceptions. <pf>substr</pf> throws an exception if we give it a bad index, as shown in this sample:</p>

  <program xml:id="program-design_exceptions-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/program-design/exceptions-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>If you run that code, you should get an error like:</p>

  <console>
  <output>
  terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::out_of_range'
  </output>
  </console>

  <p>An <pf>out_of_range</pf> exception was thrown and no one caught it. Thus the program was terminated.</p>

  <p>Let's try catching the exception in <pf>mediumJob</pf>. To catch an exception, we use this syntax:</p>
  
<program>
  try {
    // code that might throw an exception
  } catch (const exception&amp; e) {
    // code to handle the exception
  }
</program>

  <p><pf>exception</pf> is a data type defined in the <pf>&lt;exception></pf> library. <pf>catch(const exception&amp; e)</pf> says that <pf>e</pf> is going to be a const reference to an <pf>exception</pf> that is coming from somewhere else. Let's add that to our program to catch the exception that is coming from <pf>substr</pf>:</p>

  <program xml:id="program-design_exceptions-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/program-design/exceptions-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>This time, we caught the exception. The exception happens on line 10. As soon as it happens, execution jumps to the <pf>catch</pf>. Line 11 never runs. Which is good, as there is no result from line 10 that it can use. Inside the catch, line 13 runs and prints a message. <pf>exceptionName.what()</pf> results in a string that describes the exception. The code then recovers from the error by setting the <pf>mediumResult</pf> variable to a default value (<pf>"mediumJob(?)"</pf>).</p>

  <p>That result is returned to <pf>bigJob</pf> in the normal manner and the program continues on as if nothing bad happened.</p>

  <note>
    <p>Every <pf>try</pf> MUST have a catch.</p>
    <p>Execution in a <pf>try</pf> stops when an exception is thrown, none of the rest of the code in the try gets to run.</p>
