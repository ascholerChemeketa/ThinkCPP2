<title>StringBuilder Objects</title>
<p>
Here's an example in which mutable objects are efficient and arguably more natural: building a long string by concatenating lots of small pieces.
</p>

<p>
Strings are particularly inefficient for this operation.
For example, consider the following program, which reads 10 lines from <c>System.in</c> and concatenates them into a single <c>String</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="mutable-objects_stringbuilder-objects-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/mutable-objects_stringbuilder-objects-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Inside the <c>for</c> loop, <c>in.nextLine()</c> returns a new string each time it is invoked.
The next line of code concatenates <c>text</c> and <c>line</c>, which creates another string, and then appends the newline character, which creates yet another string.
</p>

<p>
As a result, this loop creates 30 <c>String</c> objects!
At the end, <c>text</c> refers to the most recent <c>String</c>.
Garbage collection deletes the rest, but that's a lot of garbage for a seemingly simple program.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>StringBuilder</h></idx>
The Java library provides the <c>StringBuilder</c> class for just this reason.
It's part of the <c>java.lang</c> package, so you don't need to import it.
Because <c>StringBuilder</c> objects are mutable, they can implement concatenation more efficiently.
</p>

<p>
Here's a version of the program that uses <c>StringBuilder</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="mutable-objects_stringbuilder-objects-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/mutable-objects_stringbuilder-objects-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The <c>append</c> function takes a <c>String</c> as a parameter and appends it to the end of the <c>StringBuilder</c>.
Each time it is invoked, it modifies the <c>StringBuilder</c>; it doesn't create any new objects.
</p>

<p>
If needed, you can return the <c>StringBuilder</c>'s contents as a string by calling the <c>toString</c> function:
</p>

<program xml:id="mutable-objects_stringbuilder-objects-3" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/mutable-objects_stringbuilder-objects-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The <c>StringBuilder</c> class also provides functions for inserting and deleting parts of strings efficiently.
Programs that manipulate large amounts of text run much faster if you use <c>StringBuilder</c> instead of <c>String</c>.
