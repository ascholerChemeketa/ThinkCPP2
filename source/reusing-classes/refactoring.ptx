<title>Refactoring</title>
<p>
Whenever you see repeated code like <pf>main</pf>, you should think about ways to remove it.
In <xref ref="eights">Chapter</xref>, we used inheritance to eliminate repeated code.
We'll do something similar with <pf>Conway</pf> and <pf>Langton</pf>.
</p>

<p>
First, we define a superclass named <pf>Automaton</pf>, in which we will put the code that <pf>Conway</pf> and <pf>Langton</pf> have in common:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/reusing-classes/refactoring-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<pf>Automaton</pf> declares <pf>grid</pf> as an instance variable, so every <pf>Automaton</pf> <q>has<nbsp/>a</q> <pf>GridCanvas</pf>.
It also provides <pf>run</pf>, which contains the code that creates and configures the <pf>JFrame</pf>.
</p>

<p>
The <pf>run</pf> function takes two parameters: the window <pf>title</pf> and the frame <pf>rate</pf>; that is, the number of time steps to show per second.
It uses <pf>title</pf> when creating the <pf>JFrame</pf>, and it passes <pf>rate</pf> to <pf>mainloop</pf>:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/reusing-classes/refactoring-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<pf>mainloop</pf> contains the code you first saw in <xref ref="mainloop">Section</xref>.
It runs a <pf>while</pf> loop forever (or until the window closes).
Each time through the loop, it runs <pf>update</pf> to update <pf>grid</pf> and then <pf>repaint</pf> to redraw the grid.
</p>

<p>
Then it calls <pf>Thread.sleep</pf> with a delay that depends on <pf>rate</pf>.
For example, if <pf>rate</pf> is 2, we should draw two frames per second, so the delay is a half second, or 500 milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>refactor</h></idx>
    <idx><h>design process</h></idx>
This process of reorganizing existing code, without changing its behavior, is known as <term>refactoring</term>.
We're almost finished; we just need to redesign <pf>Conway</pf> and <pf>Langton</pf> to extend <pf>Automaton</pf>.
