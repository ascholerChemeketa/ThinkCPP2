<title>Reusing Classes</title>


<introduction>
<p>
In <xref ref="conway">Chapter</xref>, we developed classes to implement Conway's Game of Life.
We can reuse the <c>Cell</c> and <c>GridCanvas</c> classes to implement other simulations.
One of the most interesting zero-player games is <term>Langton's Ant</term>, which models an <q>ant</q> that walks around a grid.
The ant follows only two simple rules:
<ol>
<li><p>If the ant is on a white cell, it turns to the right, makes the cell black, and moves forward.</p></li>
<li><p>If the ant is on a black cell, it turns to the left, makes the cell white, and moves forward.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Because the rules are simple, you might expect the ant to do something simple, like make a square or repeat a simple pattern.
But starting on a grid with all white cells, the ant makes more than 10,000 steps in a seemingly random pattern before it settles into a repeating loop of 104 steps.
You can read more about it at <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant"/>.

<p>
In this chapter, we present an implementation of Langton's Ant and use it to demonstrate more advanced object-oriented techniques.
