The code for this chapter is in the <term>appc</term> directory of <term>ThinkJavaCode2</term>.
See <xref ref="code">page</xref> for instructions on how to download the repository.
Before you start the exercises, we recommend that you compile and run the examples.

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
Draw the flag of Japan: a red circle on a white background that is wider than it is tall.

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
Modify <term>Mickey.java</term> to draw ears on the ears, and ears on those ears, and more ears all the way down until the smallest ears are only 3 pixels wide.
The result should look like <xref ref="fig_moose">Figure</xref>.
<term>Hint:</term> You should have to add or modify only a few lines of code.

<exercise>
<statement>
<p>
In this exercise, you will draw <q>Moir&#xe9; patterns</q> that seem to shift around as you move.
For an explanation of what is going on, see <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moire_pattern"/>.
<ol>
<li><p>Open <term>Moire.java</term> and read the <c>paint</c> function.
Draw a sketch of what you expect it to do.
Now run it.
Did you get what you expected?</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the program so that the space between the circles is larger or smaller.
See what happens to the image.</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the program so that the circles are drawn in the center of the screen and concentric, as in <xref ref="fig_moire">Figure</xref> (left).
The distance between the circles should be small enough that the Moir&#xe9; interference is apparent.

<figure xml:id="fig_moire" >
<caption>Graphical patterns that can exhibit Moir&#xe9; interference.</caption>
<image width="73%" source="external/images/moire.png" />
</figure></p></li>
<li><p>Write a function named <c>radial</c> that draws a radial set of line segments as shown in <xref ref="fig_moire">Figure</xref> (right), but they should be close enough together to create a Moir&#xe9; pattern.</p></li>
<li><p>Just about any kind of graphical pattern can generate Moir&#xe9;-like interference patterns.
Play around and see what you can create.</p></li>
