  <title>Multidimensional Vector Access</title>

  <p>To do work with our `table`, it is important to remember that `table` is just a vector with three elements (the rows).Using `table.size()` would produce 3. There are three elements in `table`. Using `table.at(0)` would get the first element - the first row of the table.</p>

  <p>To talk about one element in that row, we need to ask the row for the index we want to work with. `table.at(0).at(1)` starts by asking the table to give us element 0 (`table.at(0)`). That is the first row. Then `.at(1)` asks that row to give us the second element (index 1). The result is a reference to the value at row index 0, column index 1. We can then assign a value to it:</p>

  <program>
  table.at(0).at(1) = 3;
  </program>

  <figure>
    <caption>`table.at(0).at(1) = 3` assigns 3 to the first row, second column.</caption>
