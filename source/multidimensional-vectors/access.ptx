  <title>Multidimensional Vector Access</title>

  <p>To do work with our <pf>table</pf>, it is important to remember that <pf>table</pf> is just a vector with three elements (the rows).Using <pf>table.size()</pf> would produce 3. There are three elements in <pf>table</pf>. Using <pf>table.at(0)</pf> would get the first element - the first row of the table.</p>

    <caption><pf>table.at(0)</pf> selects the first row, which is a vector of integers.</caption>

  <p>To talk about one element in that row, we need to ask the row for the index we want to work with. <pf>table.at(0).at(1)</pf> starts by asking the table to give us element 0 (<pf>table.at(0)</pf>). That is the first row. Then <pf>.at(1)</pf> asks that row to give us the second element (index 1). The result is a reference to the value at row index 0, column index 1. We can then assign a value to it:</p>

  <program>
  table.at(0).at(1) = 3;
  </program>

  <figure>
    <caption><pf>table.at(0).at(1) = 3</pf> assigns 3 to the first row, second column.</caption>
