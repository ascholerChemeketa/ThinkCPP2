  <title>Single Dimension Traversals</title>

  <p>It is also possible to traverse just one dimension of a multidimensional set of data. Say we just want to print out the third row of a table of data. This only requires traversing in one dimension - side to side through a single row. The list of elements we need to visit looks like:</p>

<pre>
matrix.at(2).at(0)
matrix.at(2).at(1)
matrix.at(2).at(2)
matrix.at(2).at(3)
</pre>

    <image width="45%"

  </figure>

  <p>The row of everything we are trying to access is <pf>2</pf>. The column number is the only one that changes. This means we can use a set value for the row index. We still have to specify both a row and column to access a single <pf>int</pf> value in the table. We just will use a fixed value for the row.</p>
