As described in <xref ref="sec_examples">Section</xref>, it's more effective to program and debug your code little by little than to attempt writing everything all at once.
And after you've completed programming an algorithm, it's important to test that it works correctly on a variety of inputs.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the book, we illustrate techniques for testing your programs.
Most, if not all, testing is based on a simple idea: does the program do what we expect it to do?
For simple programs, it's not difficult to run them several times and see what happens.
But at some point, you will get tired of typing the same test cases over and over.
</p>

<p>
We can automate the process of entering input and comparing <term>expected output</term> with <term>actual output</term> using the command line.
The basic idea is to store the test cases in plain text files and trick Java into thinking they are coming from the keyboard.
Here are step-by-step instructions:
<ol>
<li><p>Make sure you can compile and run the <term>Convert.java</term> example in the <term>ch03</term> directory of <term>ThinkJavaCode2</term>.
(See <xref ref="code">page</xref> for instructions on how to download the repository.)</p></li>
<li><p>In the same directory as <term>Convert.java</term>, create a plain text file named <term>test.in</term> (<q>in</q> is for <q>input</q>).
Enter the following line and save the file:


<console>
<output>
193.04
</output>
</console>
</p></li>
<li><p>Create a second plain text file named <term>test.exp</term> (<q>exp</q> is for <q>expected</q>).
Enter the following line and save the file:


<console>
<output>
193.04 cm = 6 ft, 4 in
</output>
</console>
</p></li>
<li><p>Open a terminal, and change to the directory with these files.
Run the following command to test the program:


<console>
<output>
java Convert &lt; test.in > test.out
</output>
</console>
</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>redirection operator</h></idx>
    <idx><h>operator</h><h>redirection</h></idx>
    <idx><h>System.in</h></idx>
    <idx><h>System.out</h></idx>
On the command line, <c>LESS</c> and <c>MORE</c> are <term>redirection operators</term>.
The first one redirects the contents of <term>test.in</term> to <c>System.in</c>, as if it were entered from the keyboard.
The second one redirects the contents of <c>System.out</c> to a new file <term>test.out</term>, much like a screen capture.
In other words, the <term>test.out</term> file contains the output of your program.
</p>

<p>
By the way, it's perfectly okay to compile your programs in DrJava (or another environment) and run them from the command line.
Knowing both techniques allows you to use the right tool for the job.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
At this point, we just need to compare the contents <c>test.out</c> with <c>test.exp</c>.
If the files are the same, then the program outputted what we expected it to output.
If not, then we found a bug, and we can use the output to begin debugging our program.
Fortunately, there's a simple way to compare files on the command line:
</p>

<console>
<output>
diff test.exp test.out
</output>
</console>

<p>
The <c>diff</c> utility summarizes the differences between two files.
If there are no differences, it displays nothing, which in our case is what we want.
If the expected output differs from the actual output, we need to continue debugging.
Usually, the program is at fault, and <c>diff</c> provides some insight about what is broken.
But there's also a chance that we have a correct program and the expected output is wrong.
</p>

<p>
Interpreting the results from <c>diff</c> can be confusing, but fortunately many graphical tools can show the differences between two files.
For example, on Windows you can install <c>WinMerge</c>, on macOS you can use <c>opendiff</c> (which comes with Xcode), and on Linux there's <c>meld</c>, shown in <xref ref="fig_meld">Figure</xref>.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of what tool you use, the goal is the same.
Debug your program until the actual output is <term>identical</term> to the expected output.
