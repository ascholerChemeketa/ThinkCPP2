<title>The System Class</title>
<p>
<idx><h>System.out</h></idx>
We have been using <c>System.out.println</c> for a while, but you might not have thought about what it means.
<c>System</c> is a class that provides methods related to the <q>system</q>, or environment, where programs run.
It also provides <c>System.out</c>, which is a special value that has additional methods (like <c>println</c>) for displaying output.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>System.out</h></idx>
In fact, we can use <c>System.out.println</c> to display the value of <c>System.out</c>:
</p>

<program>
System.out.println(System.out);
</program>

<p>
The result is shown here:
</p>

<console>
<output>
java.io.PrintStream@685d72cd
</output>
</console>

<p>
<idx><h>package</h></idx>
<idx><h>java.io</h></idx>
This output indicates that <c>System.out</c> is a <c>PrintStream</c>, which is defined in a package called <c>java.io</c>.
A <em>package</em> is a collection of related classes; <c>java.io</c> contains classes for I/O which stands for <q>input and output</q>.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>address</h></idx>
<idx><h>hexadecimal</h></idx>
The numbers and letters after the <c>@</c> sign are the <em>address</em> of <c>System.out</c>, represented as a hexadecimal (base 16) number.
The address of a value is its location in the computer's memory, which might be different on different computers.
In this example, the address is <c>685d72cd</c>, but if you run the same code, you will likely get something else.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>library</h></idx>
As shown in <xref ref="fig_system">Figure</xref>, <c>System</c> is defined in a file called <em>System.java</em>, and <c>PrintStream</c> is defined in <em>PrintStream.java</em>.
These files are part of the Java <em>library</em>, which is an extensive collection of classes that you can use in your programs.
The source code for these classes is usually included with the compiler (see <xref ref="src_zip">Section</xref>).
