  <title>Displaying Two Messages</title>

  <p>You can put as many statements as you like in the <c>main</c> function. For example, to display
    more than one line of output we could use two <c>cout</c> statements:</p>

  <listing filename="hello2.cpp">
    <program xml:id="computer-programming_displaying-two-messages-1"
             interactive="activecode">
    <xi:include href="../programs/computer-programming_displaying-two-messages-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Notice that the first print statement has another <c>&lt;&lt;</c> after the string it is printing to
    separate the string from the next piece of data to be output. That data is <c>endl</c> which means
    "end of line" - it will ensure that anything that whatever comes next in the output will appear
    on the next line (like hitting Enter while typing). Thus we get two lines of output. </p>

  <p>As this second example shows, without the <c>endl</c> the second print statement will output to the
    same line as the first one. It also demonstrates that you can put comments at the end of a line
    as well as on lines all by themselves. The code before the <c>//</c> is not part of the comment.</p>

  <listing filename="goodbye.cpp">
    <program xml:id="computer-programming_displaying-two-messages-2"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/computer-programming_displaying-two-messages-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
    </program>
    <idx>
      <h>goodbye.cpp</h>
    </idx>
  </listing>

  <p>Notice that there is a space at the end of the first string, inside the quotation marks. That
    makes sure that there is a space after the comma in the output. Without that, the output would
    say "Goodbye,cruel world". Spaces outside the quotation marks do not affect the spacing of the output.</p>

  <p>Finally, this program omits the <c>return 0;</c> at the end of <c>main</c>. In C++, it is optional to include that line - if the programmer does not include it, it is silently added at the end of main. It is also possible to return a value other than 0. When a program returns 0, that indicates to the operating system that the program completed successfully. To indicate an error occurred, the programmer can return any non-zero value. This is a C++ feature we will not be exploring in this book.</p>
