<title>The GridCanvas Class</title>
<p>
Now that we have a <pf>Cell</pf> class and a way to represent a 2D array of cells, we can write a class to represent a grid of cells.
We encapsulate the code from the previous section and generalize it to construct a grid with any number of rows and columns:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/gridcanvas-class-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>IS-A</h></idx>
    <idx><h>HAS-A</h></idx>
    <idx><h>Graphics</h></idx>
Using vocabulary from the previous chapter, <pf>GridCanvas</pf> <q>is<nbsp/>a</q> <pf>Canvas</pf> that <q>has<nbsp/>a</q> 2D array of cells.
By extending the <pf>Canvas</pf> class from <pf>java.awt</pf>, we inherit functions for drawing graphics on the screen.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>nested</h><h>arrays</h></idx>
    <idx><h>traversal</h></idx>
In fact, the code is surprisingly straightforward: to draw the grid, we simply draw each cell.
We use nested <pf>for</pf> loops to traverse the 2D array:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/gridcanvas-class-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The outer loop traverses the rows; the inner loop traverses the cells in each row.
You can almost read this function in English: <q>For each <pf>row</pf> in the <pf>array</pf>, and for each <pf>cell</pf> in the <pf>row</pf>, draw the <pf>cell</pf> in the graphics context.</q>
Each cell contains its coordinates and size, so it knows how to draw itself.
</p>

<p>
Classes that extend <pf>Canvas</pf> are supposed to provide a function called <pf>paint</pf> that <q>paints</q> the contents of the <pf>Canvas</pf>.
It gets invoked when the <pf>Canvas</pf> is created and anytime it needs to be redrawn; for example, when its window is moved or resized.
</p>

<p>
Here's the <pf>paint</pf> function for <pf>GridCanvas</pf>.
When the window management system calls <pf>paint</pf>, <pf>paint</pf> calls <pf>draw</pf>, which draws the cells:

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_gridcanvas-class-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/gridcanvas-class-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
