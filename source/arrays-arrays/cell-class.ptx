<title>The Cell Class</title>
<p>
When drawing a cell, we'll need to know its location on the screen and size in pixels.
To represent the location, we use the <pf>x</pf> and <pf>y</pf> coordinates of the upper-left corner.
And to represent the size, we use an integer, <pf>size</pf>.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>state</h></idx>
To represent the state of a cell, we use an integer, <pf>state</pf>, which is <pf>0</pf> for dead cells and <pf>1</pf> for live cells.
We could use a <pf>boolean</pf> instead, but it's good practice to design classes to be reusable (e.g., for other games that have more states).
</p>

<p>
Here is a <pf>Cell</pf> class that declares these instance variables:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/cell-class-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Notice that <pf>x</pf>, <pf>y</pf>, and <pf>size</pf> are constants.
Once the cell is created, we don't want it to move or change size.
But <pf>state</pf> can and should change, so it is not a constant.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to write a constructor.
Here's one that takes <pf>x</pf>, <pf>y</pf>, and <pf>size</pf> as parameters, and sets <pf>state</pf> to a default value:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/cell-class-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The following function draws a cell.
Like the <pf>paint</pf> function in <xref ref="graphics">Appendix</xref>, it takes a graphics context as a parameter:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/cell-class-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The <pf>draw</pf> function uses the state of the cell to select a color from an array of <pf>Color</pf> objects.
Then it uses to <pf>fillRect</pf> to draw the center of the cell and <pf>drawRect</pf> to draw a light-gray border.
</p>

<p>
We also need functions to get and set the cell's state.
We could just provide <pf>getState</pf> and <pf>setState</pf>, but the code will be more readable if we provide functions customized for the Game of Life:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-arrays/cell-class-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
