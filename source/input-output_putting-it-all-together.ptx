<title>Putting It All Together</title>
<p>
At this point, you have seen enough Java to write useful programs that solve everyday problems.
You can (1) import Java library classes, (2) create a <c>Scanner</c>, (3) get input from the keyboard, (4) format output with <c>printf</c>, and (5) divide and mod integers.
Now we will put everything together in a complete program:
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>Convert.java</h></idx>
</p>

<listing filename="Convert.java">
<program interactive="activecode">
import java.util.Scanner;

/**
 * Converts centimeters to feet and inches.
 */
public class Convert {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double cm;
        int feet, inches, remainder;
        final double CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
        final int IN_PER_FOOT = 12;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        // prompt the user and get the value
        System.out.print("Exactly how many cm? ");
        cm = in.nextDouble();

        // convert and output the result
        inches = (int) (cm / CM_PER_INCH);
        feet = inches / IN_PER_FOOT;
        remainder = inches % IN_PER_FOOT;
        System.out.printf("%.2f cm = %d ft, %d in\n",
                          cm, feet, remainder);
    }
}
</program>
</listing>

<p>
Although not required, all variables and constants are declared at the top of <c>main</c>.
This practice makes it easier to find their types later on, and it helps the reader know what data is involved in the algorithm.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>documentation</h></idx>
For readability, each major step of the algorithm is separated by a blank line and begins with a comment.
The class also includes a documentation comment (<c>/**</c>), which you can learn more about in <xref ref="javadoc">Appendix</xref>.
</p>

<p>
Many algorithms, including the <c>Convert</c> program, perform division and modulo together.
In both steps, you divide by the same number (<c>IN_PER_FOOT</c>).
</p>

<p>
When statements including <c>System.out.printf</c> get long (generally wider than 80 characters), a common style convention is to break them across multiple lines.
The reader should never have to scroll horizontally.
