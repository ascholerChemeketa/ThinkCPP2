<title>Refactoring</title>
<p>
Whenever you see repeated code like <c>main</c>, you should think about ways to remove it.
In <xref ref="eights">Chapter</xref>, we used inheritance to eliminate repeated code.
We'll do something similar with <c>Conway</c> and <c>Langton</c>.
</p>

<p>
First, we define a superclass named <c>Automaton</c>, in which we will put the code that <c>Conway</c> and <c>Langton</c> have in common:
</p>

<program xml:id="reusing-classes_refactoring-1">
<xi:include href="../programs/reusing-classes_refactoring-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<c>Automaton</c> declares <c>grid</c> as an instance variable, so every <c>Automaton</c> <q>has<nbsp/>a</q> <c>GridCanvas</c>.
It also provides <c>run</c>, which contains the code that creates and configures the <c>JFrame</c>.
</p>

<p>
The <c>run</c> function takes two parameters: the window <c>title</c> and the frame <c>rate</c>; that is, the number of time steps to show per second.
It uses <c>title</c> when creating the <c>JFrame</c>, and it passes <c>rate</c> to <c>mainloop</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="reusing-classes_refactoring-2">
<xi:include href="../programs/reusing-classes_refactoring-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<c>mainloop</c> contains the code you first saw in <xref ref="mainloop">Section</xref>.
It runs a <c>while</c> loop forever (or until the window closes).
Each time through the loop, it runs <c>update</c> to update <c>grid</c> and then <c>repaint</c> to redraw the grid.
</p>

<p>
Then it calls <c>Thread.sleep</c> with a delay that depends on <c>rate</c>.
For example, if <c>rate</c> is 2, we should draw two frames per second, so the delay is a half second, or 500 milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>refactor</h></idx>
    <idx><h>design process</h></idx>
This process of reorganizing existing code, without changing its behavior, is known as <term>refactoring</term>.
We're almost finished; we just need to redesign <c>Conway</c> and <c>Langton</c> to extend <c>Automaton</c>.
