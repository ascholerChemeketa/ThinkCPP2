<title>CardCollection</title>
<p>
To implement Crazy Eights, we need to represent a deck of cards, a discard pile, a draw pile, and a hand for each player.
And we need to be able to deal, draw, and discard cards.
</p>

<p>
The <pf>Deck</pf> and <pf>Pile</pf> classes from the previous chapter meet some of these requirements.
But unless we make some changes, neither of them represents a hand of cards very well.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>ArrayList</h></idx>
Furthermore, <pf>Deck</pf> and <pf>Pile</pf> are essentially two versions of the same code: one based on arrays, and the other based on <pf>ArrayList</pf>.
It would be helpful to combine their features into one class that meets the needs of both.
</p>

<p>
We will define a class named <pf>CardCollection</pf> and add the code we want one step at a time.
Since this class will represent different piles and hands of cards, we'll add a <pf>label</pf> attribute to tell them apart:
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>CardCollection</h></idx>
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
As with the <pf>Pile</pf> class, we need a way to add cards to the collection.
Here is the <pf>addCard</pf> function from the previous chapter:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>this</h></idx>
Until now, we have used <pf>this</pf> explicitly to make it easy to identify attributes.
Inside <pf>addCard</pf> and other instance functions, you can access instance variables without using the keyword <pf>this</pf>.
So from here on, we will drop it:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
We also need to be able to remove cards from the collection.
The following function takes an index, removes the card at that location, and shifts the following cards left to fill the gap:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-4">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>efficiency</h></idx>
If we are dealing cards from a shuffled deck, we don't care which card gets removed.
It is most efficient to choose the last one, so we don't have to shift any cards left.
Here is an overloaded version of <pf>popCard</pf> that removes and returns the last card:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-5">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-5.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<pf>CardCollection</pf> also provides <pf>isEmpty</pf>, which returns <pf>true</pf> if there are no cards left, and <pf>size</pf>, which returns the number of cards:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-6">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-6.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  
<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-7">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-7.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
To access the elements of an <pf>ArrayList</pf>, you can't use the array <pf>[]</pf> operator.
Instead, you have to use the functions <pf>get</pf> and <pf>set</pf>.
Here is a wrapper for <pf>get</pf>:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-8">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-8.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<pf>lastCard</pf> gets the last card (but doesn't remove it):
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-9">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-9.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>modifier function</h></idx>
    <idx><h>function</h><h>modifier</h></idx>
In order to control the ways card collections are modified, we don't provide a wrapper for <pf>set</pf>.
The only modifiers we provide are the two versions of <pf>popCard</pf> and the following version of <pf>swapCards</pf>:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-10">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-10.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Finally, we use <pf>swapCards</pf> to implement <pf>shuffle</pf>, which we described in <xref ref="shuffle">Section</xref>:
</p>

<program xml:id="extending-classes_cardcollection-11">
<xi:include href="../../programs/extending-classes/cardcollection-11.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
