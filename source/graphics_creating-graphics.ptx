<title>Creating Graphics</title>
<p>
<idx><h>Canvas</h></idx>
<idx><h>Graphics</h></idx>
There are several ways to create graphics in Java; the simplest way is to use <c>java.awt.Canvas</c> and <c>java.awt.Graphics</c>.
A <c>Canvas</c> is a blank rectangular area of the screen onto which the application can draw.
The <c>Graphics</c> class provides basic drawing methods such as <c>drawLine</c>, <c>drawRect</c>, and <c>drawString</c>.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example program that draws a circle by using the <c>fillOval</c> method:
</p>

<program xml:id="graphics_creating-graphics-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/graphics_creating-graphics-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  
<program xml:id="graphics_creating-graphics-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/graphics_creating-graphics-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The <c>Drawing</c> class extends <c>Canvas</c>, so it has all the methods provided by <c>Canvas</c>, including <c>setSize</c>.
You can read about the other methods in the documentation, which you can find by doing a web search for <q>Java Canvas</q>.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>JFrame</h></idx>
In the <c>main</c> method, we do the following:
<ol>
<li><p>Create a <c>JFrame</c> object, which is the window that will contain the canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a <c>Drawing</c> object (which is the canvas), set its width and height, and add it to the frame.</p></li>
<li><p>Pack the frame (resize it) to fit the canvas, and display it on the screen.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>paint</h></idx>
Once the frame is visible, the <c>paint</c> method is called whenever the canvas needs to be drawn; for example, when the window is moved or resized.
If you run this code, you should see a black circle on a gray background.
</p>

<p>
The application doesn't end after the <c>main</c> method returns; instead, it waits for the <c>JFrame</c> to close.
When the <c>JFrame</c> closes, it calls <c>System.exit</c>, which ends the program.
</p>
