  <title>Accessing Elements</title>

  <p>When trying to visualize a vector, you should think of the name of the vector as a box
    containing a list of values. For example, you should imagine that the code `vector&lt;int>
    counts = {12, 6, 3, 14}` creates something like this: </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_vector">
    <caption>Memory diagram of vector <pf>counts</pf> containing 12, 6, 3, and 14.</caption>
    <image width="40%"
           source="images/vectors-count-full.svg"/>
  </figure>

  <p>There are times when we will just use the name of the vector to refer to the whole package. But
    most of the time, we want to access one of the elements of the vector. To do so we use the same
    syntax that we do with strings. We use the <pf>.at(index)</pf> function to specify the element we wish
    to work with:</p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/accessing-elements-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p> You can use the element retrieved by <pf>.at(index)</pf> as if it was a variable that contains that one
    element. You can assign it new values and use any appropriate operators on the result: </p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/accessing-elements-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>Note that the naming of elements can be tricky. The first element has the index 0. So some
    programmers refer to it as the <q>zeroth</q> element. But that means <q>first</q> can refer to
    the element at index 0 or 1, depending on the convention being used. For this reason, it is
    often best to explicitly refer to items by their index <q>the item at index 1</q> is much
    clearer than <q>first</q>. In this book, if we use casual language (first, second, etc...) it
    will be to refer to the <q>human numbering</q> of elements where <q>first</q> means the first,
    not the item at index 1. When using C++ numbering (0 based), we will refer to <q>the element at
    index X</q> or <q>element index x</q>.</p>

  <p>If you use <pf>.at(index)</pf> to ask for an index that is not valid (less than 0 or >= <pf>.size()</pf>),
    there will be a runtime error when that statement executes. This program runs fine until we try
    to access <pf>counts.at(4)</pf>:</p>

  <program label="vectors_accessing-elements-program-1"
           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/vectors/accessing-elements-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>As usual, the error message is a little cryptic. The important part is the <pf>out_of_range</pf>
    message. This means that the index you provided was not valid. After that, there is
    <pf>vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 4) >= this->size() (which is 4)</pf>. This tells us that the
    problem comes from a vector and we asked for index 4 in a vector with size of 4. Unfortunately,
    we do not get a line number, so we have to use print statements or a debugger to help track down
    the exact location.</p>

  <warning>
    <p>As with strings, vectors support bracket notation (<pf>vectorName[index]</pf>) notation for
      accessing elements. However, when using that syntax, there is no bounds checking. You can ask
      for element 100 in a 4 element vector and will be given some piece of memory that is unrelated
      to the vector (it will be whatever is in memory where element 100 would be if it existed).</p>
    <p>This kind of unchecked access is one of the most important sources of bugs in code (do a web
      search for <q>buffer overflow</q>). The very minimal overhead required by the safe syntax
      (<pf>.at(index)</pf>) is worth it to avoid these kinds of bugs in the vast majority of situations.</p>
