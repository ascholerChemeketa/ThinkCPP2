<title>Reading Documentation</title>
<p>
<idx><h>documentation</h></idx>
As an example, let's look at the documentation for <c>Scanner</c>, a class we first used in <xref ref="scanner">Section</xref>.
You can find the documentation quickly by doing a web search for <q>Java Scanner</q>.
<xref ref="fig_scanner">Figure</xref> shows a screenshot of the page.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_scanner" >
<caption>The documentation for <c>Scanner</c>.</caption>
<image width="95%" source="images/scanner.png" />
</figure>
<p>
Documentation for other classes uses a similar format.
The first line is the package that contains the class, such as <c>java.util</c>.
The second line is the name of the class.
The <q>All Implemented Interfaces</q> section lists some of the functionality a <c>Scanner</c> has.
</p>

<p>
The next section of the documentation is a narrative that explains the purpose of the class and includes examples of how to use it.
This text can be difficult to read, because it may use terms you have not yet learned.
But the examples are often very useful.
A good way to get started with a new class is to paste the examples into a test file and see if you can compile and run them.
</p>

<p>
One of the examples shows how you can use a <c>Scanner</c> to read input from a <c>String</c> instead of <c>System.in</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="javadoc_reading-documentation-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/javadoc_reading-documentation-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
After the narrative, code examples, and other details, you will find the following tables:
<ul>
<li>
<title>Constructor Summary:</title>
<p>
Ways of creating, or constructing, a <c>Scanner</c>.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Method Summary:</title>
<p>
The list of methods that the <c>Scanner</c> class provides.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Constructor Detail:</title>
<p>
More information about how to create a <c>Scanner</c>.</p></li>
<li>
<title>Method Detail:</title>
<p>
More information about each method.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For example, here is the summary information for <c>nextInt</c>:
</p>

<console>
<output>
public int nextInt()
Scans the next token of the input as an int.
</output>
</console>

<p>
<idx><h>signature</h></idx>
The first line is the method's <em>signature</em>, which specifies the name of the method and its parameters (none). The type it returns (<c>int</c>) is not part of the signature.
The next line is a short description of what it does.
</p>

<p>
The <q>Method Detail</q> explains more:
</p>

<console>
<output>
public int nextInt()
Scans the next token of the input as an int.

An invocation of this method of the form nextInt() behaves in
exactly the same way as the invocation nextInt(radix), where
radix is the default radix of this scanner.

Returns:
the int scanned from the input

Throws:
InputMismatchException - if the next token does not match
    the Integer regular expression, or is out of range
NoSuchElementException - if input is exhausted
IllegalStateException - if this scanner is closed
</output>
</console>

<p>
The <q>Returns</q> section describes the result when the method succeeds.
In contrast, the <q>Throws</q> section describes possible errors and exceptions that may occur.
Exceptions are said to be thrown, like a referee throwing a flag, or like a toddler throwing a fit.
</p>

<p>
It might take you some time to get comfortable reading documentation and learning which parts to ignore.
But it's worth the effort.
Knowing what's available in the library helps you avoid reinventing the wheel.
And a little bit of documentation can save you a lot of debugging.
