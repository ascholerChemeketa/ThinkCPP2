  <title>Other Escape Sequences</title>

  <p>We have already learned that printing `\t` prints a tab character instead of literally printing a `\` and a `t`. `\t` is known as an <term>escape sequence</term>.
    <idx>
      <h>escape sequence</h>
    </idx> An <term>escape sequence</term> is a sequence of characters used to represent a single character that otherwise might be hard to type or might cause issues with parsing the code. In C++ escape sequences start with a backslash `\`. Anytime you see that symbol in a char or string, it means <q>start an escape sequence</q>. The character that comes after determines what sequence it is:

  <p>An escape sequence represents a single character, and only counts as such despite looking like multiple characters. So the string `"a\tb"` has a `size()` of only 3 because `\t` is one character. The characters in that string look like:</p>
  
  <tabular>
    <row bottom="minor">
      <cell>0</cell>
      <cell>1</cell>
      <cell>2</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell>a</cell>
      <cell>(tab)</cell>
      <cell>b</cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>

  <p>Other than the tab sequence, the other text important formatting symbol is the `\n` or <term>newline</term> symbol. When a computer stores a text file, it needs a way to know where each line ends. To do that, the ASCII code 10 is used. It is referred to as the newline character and can be <q>typed</q> into a string in C++ using `\n`. When you print a newline character, the cursor moves to the beginning of the next line.
  Using this, it is possible to have a single string that represents multiple lines of output. You just have to
    tell C++ where to put the line breaks: <idx><h>newline</h></idx></p>

    <program xml:id="strings_using-escape-sequences-1"

<xi:include href="../../programs/computer-programming/using-escape-sequences-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>When the string is printed, we do not see the `\n`s, but they do create new lines.</p>

  <note><title>endl vs `\n`</title><p>endl and `\n` both allow us to print newlines. `\n` can be <q>built into</q> a string as a character while `endl` is a special message that is sent to `cout`. Generally it is preferred to use `\n` when you are trying to make the newline be part of the string (because you are doing something like building up a multiline file). If you just want to print a newline after a string, it is preferred to use `endl` instead of modifying the string to include `\n`.</p></note>

  <p>The other escape symbols are workarounds for the fact that `"`, `'`, and `\` are special symbols in strings and chars. A `"` normally marks the start or end of a string. So trying to write this causes errors for the compiler:</p>

<program>
cout &lt;&lt; "She said "Hello!" to me.";
</program>

  <p>To the compiler that looks like the string `"She said "` followed by a variable `Hello`, the symbol `!`, and then the string `" to me.".</p>

  <p>To include the quotes in the string, we need to <term>escape</term> them using `\`:</p>

  <program xml:id="strings_using-escape-sequences-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/computer-programming/using-escape-sequences-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>The same trick is true of single quotes and of backslashes. Since `\` normally means <q>this is the start of an escape sequence</q>, we need an escape sequence to indicate that the value we want is really just a backslash. We need to use this trick to represent a Windows style file path that uses backslashes:</p>

<xi:include href="../../programs/computer-programming/using-escape-sequences-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
