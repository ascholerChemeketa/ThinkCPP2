<title>Class Variables</title>
<p>
    <idx><h>class variable</h></idx>
So far you have seen local variables, which are declared inside a function, and instance variables, which are declared in a class definition, usually before the function definitions.
Now it's time to learn about <term>class variables</term>.
They are shared across all instances of the class.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>static</h></idx>
    <idx><h>variable</h><h>static</h></idx>
Like instance variables, class variables are defined in a class definition, before the function definitions.
But they are identified by the keyword <pf>static</pf>.
Here is a version of <pf>Card</pf> in which <pf>RANKS</pf> and <pf>SUITS</pf> are defined as class variables:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-objects_class-variables-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/arrays-objects/class-variables-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>garbage collection</h></idx>
Class variables are allocated when the program begins and persist until the program ends.
In contrast, instance variables like <pf>rank</pf> and <pf>suit</pf> are allocated when the program creates <pf>new</pf> objects, and they are deleted when the object is garbage-collected (see <xref ref="garbage">Section</xref>).
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>final</h></idx>
Class variables are often used to store constant values that are needed in several places.
In that case, they should also be declared as <pf>final</pf>.
Note that whether a variable is <pf>static</pf> or <pf>final</pf> involves two separate considerations:
<pf>static</pf> means the variable is <term>shared</term>, and <pf>final</pf> means the variable (or in this case, the reference) is <term>constant</term>.
</p>

<p>
Naming <pf>static final</pf> variables with capital letters is a common convention that makes it easier to recognize their role in the class.
In the <pf>toString</pf> function, we refer to <pf>SUITS</pf> and <pf>RANKS</pf> as if they were local variables, but we can tell that they are class variables.
</p>

<p>
One advantage of defining <pf>SUITS</pf> and <pf>RANKS</pf> as class variables is that they don't need to be created (and garbage-collected) every time <pf>toString</pf> is called.
They may also be needed in other functions and classes, so it's helpful to make them available everywhere.
