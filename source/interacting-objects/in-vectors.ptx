  <title>Objects in Vectors</title>

  <p>
    There are not too many differences between using a vector of objects and a vector of structs. But there are a few interactions between vectors and the constructors and <pf>const</pf> members of classes worth noting.
  </p>

  <p>On this page, we will make use of this <pf>SimplePoint1</pf> AND <pf>SimplePoint2</pf> classes. They are identical except for the fact that <pf>SimplePoint2</pf> has a no-argument constructor:</p>

  <program xml:id="simple-points" label="simple-points" filename="SimplePoint.cxx" line-numbers="yes" highlight-lines="3, 18, 20-23">
<xi:include href="../../programs/interacting-objects/in-vectors-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>


  <p>First let's try to create a vector of 5 <pf>SimplePoint1</pf>s:</p>

  <program label="in-vectors-2" add-files="simple-points" compile-with="simple-points" interactive="activecode" highlight-lines="10">
<xi:include href="../../programs/interacting-objects/in-vectors-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>We immediate get an error:</p>

  <console>
    <output>error: no matching function for call to 'SimplePoint1::SimplePoint1()</output>
  </console>

  <p>When the code tries to set up the memory for <pf>SimplePoint1</pf>, it tries to initialize each object in the vestor. There is no instruction how to do so, so it is assumed we want to use the no-arg constructor for each of the Points. But <pf>SimplePoint1</pf> does not have a no-arg constructor. To solve the problem, we have to either:
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a no-argument constructor for <pf>SimplePoint1</pf>. (We may not be able to do this if we are using someone else's class.</li>
      <li>Specify how to construct the Points in the vector.</li>
      <li>Provide an explicit list of Points.</li>
    </ul>. This sample demonstrates the approaches:</p>
  
  <program label="in-vectors-3" add-files="simple-points" compile-with="simple-points" interactive="activecode" highlight-lines="10, 13, 16">
<xi:include href="../../programs/interacting-objects/in-vectors-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>As shown on lines 23 and 24, once we have created the vector, we can access individual elements using the <pf>.at()</pf> function. Doing so names a particular <pf>Point</pf> that then we can call member functions on. So <pf>points1.at(0).getX()</pf> starts with the vector named <pf>points1</pf>, then gets the first element, which is a point, and then calls <pf>getX()</pf> on that point.</p>

  <p>We can also loop through the elements by using a range based for loop. The loop on line 27 uses <pf>const SimplePoint1&amp;</pf> as the type of each element. This way, we are using the actual objects from the vector and not making copies of them. We use <pf>const</pf> to promise that the vector elements will not change. But for that to work, we have to make sure that the <pf>getX()</pf> function is marked <pf>const</pf>. (Remember that const tends to be infectious!).</p>

  <exercise label="profgram_l3angd_1">
    <statement>
      <p>How would we call <pf>setX(5)</pf> on the second element in the vector <pf>points3</pf>?</p>
        <p><fillin mode="string"
          answer="points3.at(1).setX(5)"/></p>
    </statement>
    <evaluation>
      <evaluate>
        <test correct="yes">
          <strcmp>points3\.at\(\s*1\s*\)\.setX\(\s*5\s*\);?</strcmp>
        </test>
      </evaluate>
    </evaluation>
