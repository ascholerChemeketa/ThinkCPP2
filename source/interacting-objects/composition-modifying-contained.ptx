  <title>Modifying the Contained Members</title>

  <p>The same logic applies if want to add functions to change the location of a Circle - it does directly control the data (x and y) that needs to be changed. So any function that needs to modify those values will need to rely on calling methods on <pf>m_center</pf>.</p>

  <p>This is demonstrated in the sample below. Note that <pf>setRadius</pf> can directly do the needed work as the <pf>m_radius</pf> variable is <q>owned</q> directly by the Circle. However <pf>setX()</pf> and <pf>setY()</pf> need to ask <pf>m_center</pf> to make the needed changes:</p>
