        <title>composition:</title>
        <p>
          <idx>
            <h>composition</h>
          </idx> An object that can be modified at any time. Points and
          rectangles are mutable by design.</p>
      </li>

        <title>has a:</title>
        <p>
          <idx>
            <h>has a</h>
          </idx> A relationship between objects where one object has a member that is another object. Composition is a form of a has-a relationship.</p>

        <title>initializer list:</title>
        <p>
          <idx>
            <h>initializer list</h>
          </idx> Instructions that proceed constructor's body that control how object memory is initialized. It can be used to prevent default constructor calls being used to initialize composed members.</p>

      <li>
        <title>copy constructor:</title>
        <p>
          <idx>
            <h>copy constructor</h>
          </idx> A special constructor used to copy an object when we write something like `Point p2(p1)` (where `p1` is an existing point). Every class automatically has a copy constructor that copies all of the data from the source object to the new one.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>static members:</title>
        <p>
          <idx>
            <h>static</h>
          </idx> Static members of a class are <q>shared</q>. All instances of a class share one copy of any static member variables. Static member functions can only access static member variables and can be called directly on the class using `ClassName::function()` syntax.</p>
