<title>Polygon Objects</title>
<p>
The word polygon means <q>many angles</q>; the most basic polygons are triangles (three angles), rectangles (four angles), pentagons (five angles), and so forth.
Polygons are an important part of computer graphics because they are used to compose more complex images.
</p>

<p>
Java provides a <pf>Polygon</pf> class (in <pf>java.awt</pf>) that we can use to represent and draw polygons.
The following code creates an empty <pf>Polygon</pf> and adds three points, forming a triangle:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/polygon-objects-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Internally, <pf>Polygon</pf> objects have three attributes:
<ul>
<li><p><pf>public int npoints;</pf> <pf>     </pf> <pf>// total number of points</pf></p></li>
<li><p><pf>public int[] xpoints;</pf> <pf> </pf> <pf>// array of X coordinates</pf></p></li>
<li><p><pf>public int[] ypoints;</pf> <pf> </pf> <pf>// array of Y coordinates</pf></p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When a <pf>Polygon</pf> is created, <pf>npoints</pf> is <pf>0</pf> and the two arrays are initialized with length 4.
As points are added, <pf>npoints</pf> is incremented.
If <pf>npoints</pf> exceeds the length of the arrays, larger arrays are created, and the previous values are copied over (similar to how <pf>ArrayList</pf> works).
</p>

<p>
The <pf>Polygon</pf> class provides many useful functions, like <pf>contains</pf>, <pf>intersects</pf>, and <pf>translate</pf>.
We'll get to those later, but first we're going to do some specialization.
