    <idx><h>sprite</h></idx>
Now that our <pf>Drawing</pf> is based on <pf>Actor</pf> instead of <pf>DrawablePolygon</pf>, we can draw other types of graphics.
Here is the beginning of a class that reads an image from a file and shows the image moving across the canvas.
The class is called <pf>Sprite</pf> because a moving image is sometimes called a <term>sprite</term>, in the context of computer graphics:
</p>

<program xml:id="advanced-topics_event-listeners-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/event-listeners-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The instance variables <pf>xpos</pf> and <pf>ypos</pf> represent the location of the sprite.
<pf>dx</pf> and <pf>dy</pf> represent the velocity of the sprite in the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> directions.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>ImageIO</h></idx>
    <idx><h>javax.imageio</h></idx>
The constructor takes as parameters the name of a file and the initial position.
It uses <pf>ImageIO</pf>, from the <pf>javax.imageio</pf> package, to read the file.
If an error occurs during reading, an <pf>IOException</pf> is caught, and the program displays the stack trace for debugging.
</p>

<p>
<pf>Sprite</pf> implements two interfaces: <pf>Actor</pf> and <pf>KeyListener</pf>.
<pf>Actor</pf> requires that we provide <pf>draw</pf> and <pf>step</pf> functions:
</p>

<program xml:id="advanced-topics_event-listeners-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/event-listeners-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The <pf>draw</pf> function draws the image at the sprite's current position.
The <pf>step</pf> function changes the position based on <pf>dx</pf> and <pf>dy</pf>, which are initially zero.
</p>

<p>
<pf>KeyListener</pf> is an interface for receiving keyboard events, which means we can detect and respond to key presses.
A class that implements <pf>KeyListener</pf> has to provide the following functions:
<ul>
<li><p><pf>void keyPressed(KeyEvent e)</pf>

Invoked when a key has been <q>pressed</q>.
This function is invoked repeatedly while a key is being held down.</p></li>
<li><p><pf>void keyReleased(KeyEvent e)</pf>

Invoked when a key has been <q>released</q>, meaning it is no longer down.</p></li>
<li><p><pf>void keyTyped(KeyEvent e)</pf>

Invoked when a key has been <q>typed</q>, which generally means it has been both pressed and released.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These functions get invoked when the user presses and releases <term>any</term> key.
They take a <pf>KeyEvent</pf> object as a parameter, which specifies which key was pressed, released, or typed.
</p>

<p>
We can use these functions to design a simple animation using the arrow keys.
When the user presses up or down, the sprite will move up or down.
When the user presses left or right, the sprite will move left or right.
</p>

<p>
Here's an implementation of <pf>keyPressed</pf> that uses a <pf>switch</pf> statement to test which arrow key was pressed and sets <pf>dx</pf> or <pf>dy</pf> accordingly.
(There is no <pf>default</pf> branch, so we ignore all other keys.)
</p>

<program xml:id="advanced-topics_event-listeners-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/event-listeners-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The values of <pf>dx</pf> and <pf>dy</pf> determine how much the sprite moves each time <pf>step</pf> is invoked.
While the user holds down an arrow key, the sprite will move at a constant speed.
</p>

<p>
Here's an implementation of <pf>keyReleased</pf> that runs when the user releases the key:
</p>

<program xml:id="advanced-topics_event-listeners-4">
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/event-listeners-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
When the user releases the key, <pf>keyReleased</pf> sets <pf>dx</pf> or <pf>dy</pf> to 0, so the sprite stops moving in that direction.
</p>

<p>
We don't need the <pf>keyTyped</pf> function for this example, but it's required by the interface; if we don't provide one, the compiler will complain.
So we provide an implementation that does nothing:
</p>

<program xml:id="advanced-topics_event-listeners-5">
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/event-listeners-5.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Now, here's the code we need to create a <pf>Sprite</pf>, add it to a <pf>Drawing</pf>, and configure it as a <pf>KeyListener</pf>:
</p>

<program xml:id="advanced-topics_event-listeners-6">
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/event-listeners-6.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Recall that the <pf>add</pf> function is one that we wrote in <xref ref="sec_drawing">Section</xref>.
It adds an <pf>Actor</pf> to the list of objects to be drawn.
</p>

<p>
The <pf>addKeyListener</pf> function is inherited from <pf>Canvas</pf>.
It adds a <pf>KeyListener</pf> to the list of objects that will receive key events.
</p>

<p>
In graphical applications, key events are sent to components only when they have the keyboard focus.
The <pf>setFocusable</pf> function ensures that <pf>drawing</pf> will have the focus initially, without the user having to click it first.
