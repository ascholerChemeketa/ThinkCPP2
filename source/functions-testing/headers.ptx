  <title>Header Files</title>

  <p>So we have `library.cpp` which defines some functions that we want to make use of in
    `main.cpp`. We have seen that we can declare each function from the library in `main.cpp`. But
    we would like to avoid having to do that. This is where <term>header files</term> come in. A
    header file is a file that contains the function declarations for a `.cpp` file. <idx>
      <h>header file</h>
    </idx></p>

  <p>Here is the header file that corresponds to `library.cpp`:</p>

  <listing>
    <caption>`library.h`</caption>
    <program label="functions-testing_headers-library.h"
             line-numbers="yes"
             highlight-lines="3,5,16">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/headers-library.h" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Key things to note: <ul>
      <li>It has the same name as the `.cpp` file, but with a `.h` extension. This is a convention,
    not a strict requirement.</li>
      <li>It has the declarations for the function(s) that exist in the .cpp file, but it does NOT
    have the definitions.</li>
      <li>The function's comment goes in the .h file with the declaration. The .h file is what <q>
    other</q> programmers should refer to when they want to know what is in `library.cpp` and how to
    use it - ideally they should never need to look in the .cpp file.</li>
      <li>Around the function declarations there is the special `#ifndef ... #endif` construct
    (lines 3, 5, 16). These lines ensure that even if we include this file multiple times, it will
    only be read one time. Line 3 asks <q>Have we not defined LIBRARY_H?</q> (`ifndef`). If we have
    not, we keep going. Otherwise, all the code until the `endif` is skipped. The first thing we do
    inside the `ifndef` is to define `LIBRARY_H`. That way, if we end up in this file again, it will
    be clear we have already seen the code. The name we check/define can be anything, but by
    convention, it usually matches the name of the file (in this case `LIBRARY_H`).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The header file is designed for `.cpp` files to include it using the <c>#include</c> directive:</p>

  <listing>
    <caption>`main.cpp` (with include)</caption>
    <program label="functions-testing_headers-main-3.cpp">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/headers-main-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>
  </listing>

  <p>Now, when the compiler is working on `main.cpp`, it will see the `#include "library.h"`
    directive and read the contents of `library.h` into the file. (Including a file essentially
    copies it into the file that has the include.) This means that the compiler will know about the
    `doubleValue` function and be able to compile the code in `main.cpp` that calls it.</p>

  <p>Note that this use of include uses `" "` around the name of the file to include instead of
    `\&lt; &gt;`. The angle brackets say <q>this is a standard library, look for it with the
    compiler's file</q>. The quotes say <q>this is a library that is NOT part of the standard
    compiler libraries, look for it in our files</q>. We use `#include &lt;iostream&gt;` because
    `iostream` is a standard library. Our `library.h` file is not.</p>

  <warning>
    <p>If you use the wrong symbols around the filename in your include, the compiler may not find
      the file because it is looking in the wrong folder.</p>
  </warning>

  <p>Generally, a .cpp file will include it's own .h - we would use `#include "library.h"` in the
    library.cpp file as well as the main file. We still only compile the .cpp files - the .h file(s)
    just get included as the .cpp files are compiled. So the recipe to compile these three files
    would still be:</p>

  <console>
    <input>g++ main.cpp library.cpp -o program.exe</input>
  </console>

           width="60%"/>
  </figure>

  <p>Finally, note that we do not normally have a <q>main.h</q>. `main.cpp` does not have functions
    that are used in any other files and the whole point of a `.h` is to share a list of
    declarations for the functions available in a file.</p>
