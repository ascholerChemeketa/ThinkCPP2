  <title>Math functions, continued</title>

  <p>At this point, you should take a few minutes to scan the <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath">list
    of functions offered in the cmath library</url>. You do not need to memorize them, but it is
    useful to be aware of what is there so you can go look up the exact syntax when you need to do
    some math. Below are tips about the trigonometric and rounding functions.</p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>degrees</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>radians</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>pi</h>
    </idx> One thing that can cause confusion is the units used for trigonometric
    functions <mdash/> <c>sin</c>, <c>cos</c>, and <c>tan</c>. Angle measurements must be in <term>radians</term>.
    To convert from degrees to radians, you divide by 180 and multiply by <m>\pi</m>. Unfortunately
    C++ does not traditionally provide an approximation for <m>\pi</m> in the cmath library! If you
    need it, you can use the trick that <m>acos(-1) = \pi</m>:</p>

  <program xml:id="functions-testing_math-functions-continued-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/math-functions-continued-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>Similarly, <m>\pi</m>. The following program demonstrates this:</p>

  <program xml:id="functions-testing_math-functions-continued-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/math-functions-continued-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>One last group of functions it is worth knowing about are the <c>floor</c>, <c>ceil</c>, <c>round</c>, and <c>trunc</c>
    functions. <c>floor</c> rounds down to the nearest whole number, while <c>ceil</c> rounds up to the next
    nearest integer. <c>round</c> rounds to the nearest integer, while <c>trunc</c> <term>truncates</term>
    (removes) the decimal part of the number. The following program demonstrates their use:</p>

  <program xml:id="functions-testing_math-functions-continued-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/functions-testing/math-functions-continued-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
