  <title>What Is Computer Science?</title>

  <p>Given a problem,
    a computer scientist's goal is to develop an <term>algorithm</term>, a step-by-step list of instructions for solving any instance of the problem that might
    arise. These algorithms are implemented as programs so that they can be executed by a computer.<idx>

  </p>

  <p>This book intentionally omits some details about the C++ language, because our main goal is
    teaching you how to think like a computer scientist. Learning how to read and write code is
    an essential part of becoming a computer scientist, but it is not the the only part.</p>

  <p>One of the most interesting aspects of writing programs is deciding how to solve a particular
    problem, especially when there are multiple solutions. For example, there are numerous ways to
    sort a list of numbers, and each way has its advantages. In order to determine which way is best
    for a given situation, we need techniques for describing and analyzing solutions formally. </p>

  <p><term>Computer
    science</term> is the science of algorithms, including their discovery and analysis. As you
    learn to develop algorithms for problems you haven't solved before, you will learn to think like
    a computer scientist.
