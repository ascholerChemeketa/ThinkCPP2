  <title>What Is Programming?</title>
  <p>A <term>program</term> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation on
    computer hardware. The computation might be something mathematical, like solving a system of
    equations or finding the roots of a polynomial. It could also be a symbolic computation, like
    searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program. <idx>

  </p>

  <p>The instructions (or commands, or statements) look different in
    different programming languages, but there are a few basic features
    that appear in just about every language:</p>
  <p>
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>input:</title>
        <p>Get data from the keyboard, or a file, or some other device.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>output:</title>
        <p>Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>math:</title>
        <p>Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and
          multiplication.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>selection:</title>
        <p>Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of
          statements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>repetition:</title>
        <p>Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</p>
      </li>
    </dl>
  </p>

  <p>Believe it or not, that's pretty much all there is to it. Every
    program you've ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of small instructions that look
    much like these. So you can think of <term>programming</term> as the process of breaking down a
    large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks. The process continues until the subtasks
    are simple enough to be performed with the electronic circuits provided by the hardware.
