  <title>What Is a Computer?</title>

  <p>When people hear the word <term>computer</term>, they often think of a desktop or a laptop. Not
    surprisingly, searching for <q>computer</q> on <url href="https://images.google.com/">Google
    Images</url> displays rows and rows of these types of machines. However, in a more general
    sense, a computer can be any type of device that stores and processes data.

  <p>Dictionary.com defines a computer as <q>a programmable electronic device designed to accept
    data, perform prescribed mathematical and logical operations at high speed, and display the
    results of these operations. Mainframes, desktop and laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones
    are some of the different types of computers.</q>
  </p>

  <p>Each type of computer has its own unique design, but internally they all share the same type
    of <term>hardware</term>. The two most important hardware components are <term>
      processors</term> (or CPUs) that perform simple calculations and <term>memory</term> (or RAM) that
    temporarily stores information. <xref ref="fig_cpuram">Figure</xref> shows what these components
    look like. </p>

  <p>Users generally see and interact with touchscreens, keyboards, and monitors, but it's the
    processors and memory that perform the actual computation. Nowadays it's fairly standard, even
    for a smartphone, to have at least eight processors and four gigabytes (four billion cells) of
    memory. </p>
