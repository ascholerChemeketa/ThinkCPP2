  <title>Formatting Source Code</title>
  <p>In C++ source code, some spaces are required. For example, you need at least one space between
    words, so this program is not legal. Try running it to see what error message you get.</p>

  <program xml:id="computer-programming_formatting-source-code-1"
           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/computer-programming/formatting-source-code-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>But most other spaces are optional. For example, this program <term>is</term> legal: </p>

  <program xml:id="computer-programming_formatting-source-code-2"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/computer-programming/formatting-source-code-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>The newlines are optional, too. So we could just write this: </p>

  <program xml:id="computer-programming_formatting-source-code-3"
            interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/computer-programming/formatting-source-code-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>It still works, but the program is getting harder and harder to read. Newlines and spaces are
    important for visually organizing your program, making it easier to understand the program and
    find errors when they occur.</p>

  <insight>
    <p>We write code to communicate not just with the compiler, but also to communicate with other
      humans. The compiler doesn't care about spaces or newlines, but humans do. Code that is
      formatted in a consistent way is easier to read and understand. </p>
  </insight>

  <p>There are conventions for not just where to use spaces, but where to break lines of code up,
    how to indent code, etc... Sometimes, there is more than one convention - some programmers
    prefer using tabs to indent lines of code, while others prefer spaces (often if you press the
    tab key, your editor will automatically turn it into a series of spaces).</p>

  <p>When working alone, a programmer can pick any style they like. However, when programmers are
    collaborating, it is important to share a consistent style. Organizations that do a lot of
    software development usually have strict guidelines on how to format source code. For example,
    Google publishes its <url href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html">C++ coding
    standards</url>. You probably won't understand these guidelines now, because they refer to
    language features you haven't yet seen. But you might want to refer to them periodically as you
    read this book. <idx>
      <h>Google C++ style</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>style guide</h>
    </idx>
  </p>

  <p>The good news is that most code editors will help automatically format source code and can even
    re-format code that is not well-formatted. You may have to do a little work to tell the editor
    what style you want to use, but then it can help, make sure your code is well formatted.</p>

    <statement>
      <p>Which best expresses what is true about whitespace (spaces and newlines) in C++ programs?</p>

          <p>C++ is actually pretty flexible about whitespace.</p>

        <statement>
          <p>C++ is flexible about whitespace, but using it consistently and following conventions is important for human programmers.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>There is not one "true" style, but it is important that programmers working together use consistent styling.</p>
        </feedback>
      </choice>
      <choice>
        <statement>
          <p>C++ is flexible about whitespace, so each programmer should develop their own personal style.</p>
        </statement>
        <feedback>
          <p>We write code as much for other people as we do for computers. It is important that others can look at your code and quickly make sense of it.</p>
