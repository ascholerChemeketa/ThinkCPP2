  <title>Debugging Programs</title>

  <p>Designing algorithms and writing code is difficult and error-prone.
    For historical reasons, programming errors are called <term>bugs</term>, and the process of
    tracking them down and correcting them is called <term>debugging</term>. As you learn to debug
    your programs, you will develop new problem-solving skills. You will need to think creatively
    when unexpected errors happen.

  <p>Although it can be frustrating, debugging is an intellectually rich, challenging, and
    interesting part of computer science. In some ways, debugging is like detective work. You are
    confronted with clues, and you have to infer the processes and events that led to the results
    you see. Thinking about how to correct programs and improve their performance sometimes even
    leads to the discovery of new algorithms.</p>

  <p>Debugging is like an experimental science: once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you
    modify your program and try again. If your hypothesis was correct, then you can predict the
    result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If your hypothesis
    was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. <idx>

  <p>Programming and debugging should go hand in hand. Don't just write a bunch of code and then
    perform trial-and-error debugging until it all works. Instead, start with a program that does <term>
    something</term> and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, until the program does
    what you want. That way, you will always have a working program, and isolating errors will be
    easier.</p>

  <note><p>Programming sometimes brings out strong emotions. If you are struggling with a
    difficult bug, you might feel angry, despondent, or embarrassed. Remember that you are not
    alone, and virtually every programmer has had similar experiences. Don't hesitate to reach out
    to a classmate, tutor, or instructor and ask questions!</p></note>
