Now that you know about interfaces and events, we can show you a better way to create animations.
Previously, we implemented the animation loop by using <pf>while (true)</pf> and <pf>Thread.sleep</pf>.
Java provides a <pf>Timer</pf> class (in <pf>javax.swing</pf>) that encapsulates this behavior.
</p>

<p>
A <pf>Timer</pf> is useful for executing code at regular intervals.
The constructor for <pf>Timer</pf> takes two parameters:
<ul>
<li><p><pf>int delay</pf> <pf>                         </pf> <pf>// milliseconds between events</pf></p></li>
<li><p><pf>ActionListener listener</pf> <pf> </pf> <pf>// for handling timer events</pf></p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The <pf>ActionListener</pf> interface requires only one function, <pf>actionPerformed</pf>.
This is the function the <pf>Timer</pf> invokes after the given delay.
</p>

<p>
Using a <pf>Timer</pf>, we can reorganize the code in <pf>main</pf> by defining a class that implements <pf>ActionListener</pf>:
</p>

<program label="advanced-topics_timers-program-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/advanced-topics/timers-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The <pf>main</pf> function constructs a <pf>VideoGame</pf> object, which creates a <pf>Sprite</pf>, a <pf>Drawing</pf>, and a <pf>JFrame</pf>.
Then it constructs a <pf>Timer</pf> object and starts the timer.
Every 33 milliseconds, the <pf>Timer</pf> invokes <pf>actionPerformed</pf>, which invokes <pf>step</pf> on the <pf>Drawing</pf>.
</p>

<p>
<pf>Drawing.step</pf> invokes <pf>step</pf> on all of its <pf>Actor</pf> objects, which causes them to update their position, color, or other aspects of their appearance.
The <pf>Drawing.step</pf> then repaints the <pf>Canvas</pf>, and the time step is done.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you have all of the elements you need to write your own video games.
In the exercises at the end of this chapter, we have some suggestions for getting started.
</p>

<p>
We hope this final chapter has been a helpful summary of topics presented throughout the book, including input and output, decisions and loops, classes and functions, arrays and objects, inheritance, and graphics.
Congratulations on making it to the end!
