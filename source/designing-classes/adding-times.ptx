<title>Adding Times</title>
<p>
Suppose you are going to a movie that starts at 18:50 (that is, 6:50 PM), and the running time is 2 hours, 16 minutes.
What time does the movie end?
We'll use <pf>Time</pf> objects to figure it out:
</p>

<program xml:id="designing-classes_adding-times-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/adding-times-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>Time</h><h>addition</h></idx>
    <idx><h>addition</h><h>time</h></idx>
Here are two ways we could <q>add</q> the <pf>Time</pf> objects:
<ul>
<li><p>Write a static function that takes two <pf>Time</pf> objects as parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an instance function that gets invoked on one object and takes the other as a parameter.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To demonstrate the difference, we'll do both.
Here is the static function:
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>static</h></idx>
    <idx><h>function</h><h>static</h></idx>
</p>

<program xml:id="designing-classes_adding-times-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/adding-times-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
And here's how we would invoke it:
</p>

<program xml:id="designing-classes_adding-times-3">
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/adding-times-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Here's what it looks like as an instance function:
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>instance function</h></idx>
    <idx><h>function</h><h>instance</h></idx>
</p>

<program xml:id="designing-classes_adding-times-4">
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/adding-times-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
And here's how we would invoke it:
</p>

<program xml:id="designing-classes_adding-times-5">
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/adding-times-5.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Notice the differences:
<ul>
<li><p>The static function has the keyword <pf>static</pf>; the instance function does not.</p></li>
<li><p>The static function has two parameters, <pf>t1</pf> and <pf>t2</pf>.
The instance function has one explicit parameter, <pf>t2</pf>, and the implicit parameter, <pf>this</pf>.</p></li>
<li><p>We invoked the static function with the <pf>Time</pf> class;
we invoked the instance function with the <pf>startTime</pf> object.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
That's all there is to it.
Static functions and instance functions do the same thing, and you can convert from one to the other with just a few changes.
</p>

<p>
However, there's a problem with both of these functions; they are not correct.
The result from either function is <pf>20:66</pf>, which is not a valid time.
</p>

<p>
If <pf>second</pf> exceeds 59, we have to carry into the minutes column, and if <pf>minute</pf> exceeds 59, we have to carry into <pf>hour</pf>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a better version of the instance function, <pf>add</pf>:
</p>

<program xml:id="designing-classes_adding-times-6">
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/adding-times-6.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
If <pf>hour</pf> exceeds 23, we subtract 24 hours, but there's no
<pf>days</pf> attribute to carry into.
