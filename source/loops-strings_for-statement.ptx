The loops we have written so far have three parts in common.
They start by initializing a variable, they have a condition that depends on that variable, and they do something inside the loop to update that variable.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>iteration</h></idx>
Running the same code multiple times is called <em>iteration</em>.
It's so common that there is another statement, the <c>for</c> loop, that expresses it more concisely.
For example, we can rewrite the 2-4-6-8 loop this way:
</p>

<program>
for (int i = 2; i &lt;= 8; i += 2) {
    System.out.print(i + ", ");
}
System.out.println("Who do we appreciate?");
</program>

<p>
<c>for</c> loops have three components in parentheses, separated by semicolons: the initializer, the condition, and the update:
<ol>
<li><p>The <em>initializer</em> runs once at the very beginning of the loop.
It is equivalent to the line before the <c>while</c> statement.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>condition</em> is checked each time through the loop.
If it is <c>false</c>, the loop ends.
Otherwise, the body of the loop is executed (again).</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of each iteration, the <em>update</em> runs, and we go back to step<nbsp/>2.</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The <c>for</c> loop is often easier to read because it puts all the loop-related statements at the top of the loop.
Doing so allows you to focus on the statements inside the loop body.
<xref ref="fig_for">Figure</xref> illustrates <c>for</c> loops with a flowchart.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_for" >

</figure>
<p>
There is another difference between <c>for</c> loops and <c>while</c> loops: if you declare a variable in the initializer, it exists only <em>inside</em> the <c>for</c> loop.
For example:
</p>

<program>
for (int n = 3; n > 0; n--) {
    System.out.println(n);
}
System.out.println("n is now " + n);  // compiler error
</program>

<p>
The last line tries to display <c>n</c> (for no reason other than demonstration), but it won't work.
If you need to use a loop variable outside the loop, you have to declare it <em>outside</em> the loop, like this:
</p>

<program>
int n;
for (n = 3; n > 0; n--) {
    System.out.println(n);
}
System.out.println("n is now " + n);
</program>

<p>
Notice that the <c>for</c> statement does not say <c>int n = 3</c>.
Rather, it simply initializes the existing variable <c>n</c>.
