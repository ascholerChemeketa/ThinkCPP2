  <title>Identifiers</title>
  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>identifier</h>
    </idx> The name a variable is given is formally called an <term>
    identifier</term>.
    An identifier can be any sequence of letters and digits, but it must begin with a letter. It is
    also allowed to use the underscore character (<c>_</c>) in an identifier. Below are some examples
    of legal variable names and illegal ones: </p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>keyword</h>
    </idx>There are some words that are reserved in C++ and cannot be used as
    identifiers. These words include ones you have already encountered like <c>int</c> and <c>using</c>, you
    will encounter more as you learn more about the language. These reserved words are known as <term>
    keywords</term>. You can find a full list of keywords at <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword">
    cppreference</url>, but you don't
    have to memorize them. Most programming editors provide <q>syntax highlighting</q>, which will 
    use a different color for keywords. And the compiler will complain even
    if one does sneak past you and your editor. </p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>case-sensitive</h>
    </idx> Variable names usually begin with a lowercase letter. 
    When a variable name contains more than one word (like <c>firstName</c>), it is conventional to capitalize the first letter of
    each subsequent word. Variable names are case-sensitive, so <c>firstName</c> is not the same as <c>firstname</c>
    or <c>FirstName</c>.</p>


  <p>Beyond the syntax requirements, there are also conventions for naming variables. For example,
    it is common to use lowercase letters for variable names, and to capitalize the first letter of
    each subsequent word in a multi-word name. For example, <c>firstName</c> is a common way to name a
    variable that stores a person's first name. This style of naming is called <term>camelCase</term>
    (the uppercase letters look a little like the humps on a camel). That is the style used in this
    book. Another common style is <term>snake_case</term>, where words are separated by underscores,
    like <c>first_name</c>. Like other formatting choices, there is not a single <q>right</q> way to name
    variables, but it is important to be consistent. </p>

  <note>
    <p>Case matters! If you get an error that looks like:</p>
    <console><output>error: ‘myname’ was not declared in this scope</output></console>
    <p>Double check that your identifier isn't actually <c>myName</c></p>
