<title>Preface</title>


<introduction>
<p>
<em>Core CS - C++</em> is an introduction to computer science and programming intended for readers with little or no experience.
We start with the most basic concepts and are careful to define all terms when they are first used.
The book presents each new idea in a logical progression.
Larger topics, like control flow statements and object-oriented programming, are divided into smaller examples and introduced over the course of several chapters.
</p>

<p>
This book is intentionally concise.
Each chapter is 12<ndash/>14 pages and covers the material for one week of a college course.
It is not meant to be a comprehensive presentation of C++, but rather, an initial exposure to programming constructs and techniques.
