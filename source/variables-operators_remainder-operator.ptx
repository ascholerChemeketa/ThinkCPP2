  <title>Remainder Operator</title>
  <!-- TODO - fix xml ids -->
  <p>Say you know that someone is 68 inches tall, and you want to express their height in feet and inches. As we just saw, dividing 68 by 12 will give you a whole number answer - in this case, 5. How do you calculate the leftover inches?</p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>modulo</h>
    </idx>

      <h>% remainder operator</h>
    </idx>
<idx>
      <h>remainder</h>
    </idx> You have already seen the division operation (<c>/</c>), which
    computes the quotient of two numbers. If the numbers are integers, the operation is integer
    division. C++ also provides the <term>modulo</term> operation (<c>%</c>), which divides two
    numbers and computes the remainder. </p>

  <p> Using division and modulo, we can convert to feet and inches like this: </p>

  <program xml:id="input-output_remainder-operator-1">
<xi:include href="../programs/input-output_remainder-operator-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p> The first line yields 5. The second line, which is pronounced <q>height mod 12</q>, yields 8. So
    68 inches is 5 feet, 8 inches. </p>

      <h>divisible</h>
    </idx>
<idx>
      <h>extract digits</h>
    </idx> Modular arithmetic turns out to be surprisingly useful. For
    example, you can check whether one number is divisible by another: if <c>x % y</c> is <c>0</c>, then <c>x</c>
    is divisible by <c>y</c>. You can use the remainder operator to <q>extract</q> digits from a
    number: <c>x % 10</c> yields the rightmost digit of <c>x</c>, and <c>x % 100</c> yields the last two digits.
    And many encryption algorithms use remainders extensively. </p>
