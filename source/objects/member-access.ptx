  <title>Working with Members</title>

  <subsection>

    <title>Accessing Member Variables in the Class</title>
    <p>Look closely at the function <pf>getX()</pf>. What looks odd?</p>

    <program>
class Point {
private:
    double m_x, m_y;

public:
    double getX() {
        return m_x;
    }
}
  </program>

    <p>Notice that there is no declaration of <pf>m_x</pf> in this function! It is not declared as a
      parameter, nor is it declared as a local variable. So what is it?</p>

    <p>It is the member variable of Point named <pf>m_x</pf>. Inside member functions, we always have
      access to the member variables of the object.</p>

    <p>To call a member function, we always need to call it on a particular object:</p>
    <program>
p1.getX();
p2.getX();
</program>

    <p>Trying to use a member function without an object is a syntax error. There is no <pf>getX()</pf>
      function, there is only the <pf>getX()</pf> function that is a member of the <pf>Point</pf> class.
      (<pf>Point::getX()</pf> is the full name of this function - <q>the getX that is a part of Point</q>.)</p>

    <p>So when we say <pf>p1.getX()</pf> we are asking that object to execute the <pf>getX()</pf> code. When that
      code refers to <pf>return m_x;</pf>, it means <q>the <pf>m_x</pf> value of <pf>p1</pf></q>. Later on, if we say
      <pf>p2.getX()</pf>, the line <pf>return m_x;</pf>, it now means <q>the <pf>m_x</pf> value of <pf>p2</pf></q>.</p>

    <p> Run this Codelens sample. Pay special attention each time it enters the <pf>getX</pf> function. You
      will see a stack frame for <pf>Point::getX()</pf>, and in that stack frame, you will see a variable
      called <pf>this</pf> that points at the object that is running the code. During the first call to
      <pf>Point::getX()</pf>, it will point to <pf>p1</pf> since we called <pf>p1.getX()</pf> on line 23. Then, on line
      26 when we call <pf>p2.getX()</pf>, <pf>this</pf> will be pointing at <pf>p2</pf>.</p>

    <program label="objects_member-access-program-1"
             interactive="codelens">
<xi:include href="../../programs/objects/member-access-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>A hand drawn memory diagram might look like this:</p>

    <figure align="center">
      <caption>A memory diagram of p1 executing getX</caption>
      <image source="images/objects-this.svg"
            width="50%"
            alt="When getX is called on p1, this refers to p1"/>
    </figure>

    <note>
      <p>We will learn more about exactly what <pf>this</pf> in <xref ref="pointers-aggregation_this"/>. For now, you can think of it as an
        alias for <q>the object running the code</q>. When we say <pf>m_x</pf> in a member function, it is
        understood to mean <pf>this->m_x</pf> or <q>the <pf>m_x</pf> variable of the object running this code</q>.</p>

    <title>Setters and Mutators</title>
    <p>If we want to provide the ability for outside code to modify a member variable, we can add a <term>
      setter</term> function. These are functions that take a value and use that to set a member
      variable. This version of the Point class adds a setter for <pf>m_x</pf>:</p>

    <program label="objects_member-access-program-2"
             interactive="codelens">
<xi:include href="../../programs/objects/member-access-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>When main calls <pf>p1.setX(5.0)</pf>, it passes in the value 5. The <pf>Point::setX()</pf> function stores
      that value into the <pf>m_x</pf> instance variable of <pf>p1</pf>.</p>

    <p>As with getters, setters provide a limited way for outside code to manipulate the object.
      Outside code can't directly change <pf>m_x</pf>, it has to use the interface to ask a given point to
      please make the change to itself. This means that we have loose coupling and also that the
      class can <q>protect itself</q> from unsafe or unwanted changes.</p>

    <p>Say you are creating a Person class and you want to make sure that the age of a person never
      gets set to a negative value. You could design the class to prevent that from happening:</p>
    <program label="objects_member-access-program-3"
             interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/objects/member-access-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

    <p>When other code tries to set a negative age, the <pf>Person</pf> class ignores that request and
      prints an error message. (It would make even more sense in a real program to throw an
      exception there.)</p>

    <insight>
      <p>Remember the <q>two programmers</q> tip for understanding Object Oriented Programming.</p>
      <p>The person programming <pf>Person</pf> is the expert who knows all the important ins and outs of
        the Person class. They know that a negative value is going to cause problems later. The
        person programming main does not realize that issue even exists. If they could set `p1.m_age
        = -5;` directly, they could end up causing the program to do something horrible later on.</p>
      <p>By forcing others to use the public interface and then preventing unwanted modifications in
        that interface, the programmer of the Point class is able to limit the potential for such
        issues.</p>
    </insight>

    <p>Setters are a special kind of <term>mutator</term> function. A mutator is any function that
      changes the state of an object. While a <term>setter</term> sets a member to a particular
      value, another kind of mutator might set more than one value or change a variable in a way
      that doesn't allow outside code to set a particular value.<idx>
        <h>mutator</h>
      </idx></p>

    <p>For instance, a person might have a <pf>void getOlder()</pf> function that looked like:</p>
    <program>
class Person {
private:
    int m_age;
public:
    void getOlder() {
        m_age++;
    }
    ...
    </program>

    <p><pf>getOlder</pf> mutates (changes) the object. But it doesn't allow other code to change the age to
      an arbitrary value.</p>
