  <title>Objects</title>

  <p>As we learned while working with strings, <term>object</term>s are entities in code that unite
    some data (state) and functions that work on that data (behaviors)<idx>
      <h>object</h>
    </idx>. When other parts of a program's code are making use of an object, they rely on those
    functions to work with object and manipulate its state.</p>

  <p>You can think of an object as being like a struct that has built in
    functions. To understand how objects are different than structs, let's start by comparing procedural code that we
    might write to define and work with a Point struct with the object-oriented code we would write for a Point
    object.</p>
    
    <p>Below the two approaches are presented side by side. Don't worry about trying to understand all of the
    code. For now, just note some key differences. We will learn about why the code is different in
    the next few sections. <ul>
      <li>We have a <pf>class Point</pf> instead of a <pf>struct Point</pf>. (line 7)</li>
      <li>The keywords public and private appear in the class. (lines 8, 11)</li>
      <li>The member variables <pf>x</pf> and <pf>y</pf> have been renamed <pf>m_x</pf> and <pf>m_y</pf> (line 9).</li>
      <li>The functions are defined inside of the class. (The class does not end until line 32).</li>
      <li>The <pf>createPoint</pf> function is now just called <pf>Point</pf>. And it lacks a return type! (line
    13)</li>
      <li>The <pf>shift</pf> and <pf>toString</pf> functions do not take a <pf>Point</pf> parameter (lines 19 and 26).</li>
      <li>The code that is using the <pf>Point</pf> (the <pf>main</pf> function), calls functions on a particular
    point instead of passing points as parameters. It is <pf>p1.toString</pf> instead of <pf>toString(p1)</pf>.
    (line 36).</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <note>
    <p>In truth, C++ structs are much more similar to classes than we are describing in this
      chapter. Everything that can be done with classes can be done with structs as well. The only
      major difference is that struct members are public by default while class members are private.</p>
    <p>We are intentionally only using the basic features of structs to emphasize the
      conceptual differences between procedural programming and object oriented programming.</p>

  <exercise label="objects_objects-ex-1">
    <statement>
      <p>In the struct version, <pf>main</pf> calls <pf>shiftPoint(p1, 1.0, 2.0);</pf> to move p1 over 1 and up 2. Look at the object version of the code for the equivalent object-oriented syntax.</p>
      <p>Now imagine the struct version said <pf>shiftPoint(p3, 0, 5.1);</pf>. What would the equivalent object-oriented version be? <fillin mode="string" case="insensitive" answer="p3.shiftPoint(0, 5.1);"/>.
      </p>
