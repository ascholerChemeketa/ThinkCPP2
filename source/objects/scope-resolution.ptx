  <title>Defining Functions Outside of the Class</title>

  <p>We previously learned that we can declare functions (provide the prototype) in one place and define them (write their full bodies) elsewhere.
    Doing so allows:
    <ul>
      <li>Us to define functions in any order we want (as long as we declare them first).</li>
      <li>Create a list of the available functions without wading into the implementation details.</li>
      <li>Satisfy the demands of the C++ compiler when breaking code into multiple files.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>However, if we try to separate definitions of member functions from their declarations, we will
    run into an issue. Here is a failed attempt to move the <pf>Point</pf> constructor's definition
    outside of the class:</p>

  <program interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/objects/headers-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>Attempting to build the code fails. The compiler has no idea what line 11 is doing. It looks
    like a function called <q>Point</q> that has no return type. And in that function, we use
    variables <pf>m_x</pf> and <pf>m_y</pf> without ever declaring them. There are similar issues with the <pf>getX</pf>
    function.</p>

  <p>What the compiler needs is a hint that these functions are members of the class <pf>Point</pf>. We do
    that by adding the class name and the <term>scope resolution operator</term> <pf>::</pf> to the function definitions. Saying
    <pf>Point::getX</pf> says <q>This is the getX that belongs to Point.</q> And saying <pf>Point::Point</pf> says <q>This
    is the constructors that belongs to Point.</q> Here is a working version of the code:</p>

  <program interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/objects/headers-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <insight>
    <p>Any time you want to define a function outside of the class declaration, you need to use the
      scope resolution operator.</p>

          Correct! When you write member functions outside of the class definition, you need to specify the scope, hence the :: operator!

        </statement>
        <feedback>
          We use the <pf>::</pf> operator when referring to a member function outside the class. The
            <pf>{}</pf> brackets are not used in this case.
