<title>Using the Code Examples</title>
<p>
Most of the code examples in this book are available from a Git repository at \url{https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2}.
Git is a <q>version control system</q> that allows you to keep track of the files that make up a project.
A collection of files under Git's control is called a <q>repository</q>.

<idx><h>GitHub</h></idx>
GitHub is a hosting service that provides storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface.
It provides several ways to work with the code:
<ul>
<li><p>You can create a copy of the repository on GitHub by clicking the <em>Fork</em> button.
If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one.
After forking, you'll have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track of code you write.
Then you can <q>clone</q> the repository, which downloads a copy of the files to your computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, you could clone the original repository without forking.
If you choose this option, you don't need a GitHub account, but you won't be able to save your changes on GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the code in a ZIP archive using the <em>Clone</em> button on the GitHub page, or this link: \url{https://thinkjava.org/code2zip}.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
After you clone the repository or unzip the ZIP file, you should have a directory named <em>ThinkJavaCode2</em> with a subdirectory for each chapter in the book.
</p>

<p>
The examples in this book were developed and tested using OpenJDK<nbsp/>11.
If you are using a more recent version, everything should still work.
If you are using an older version, some of the examples might not.
