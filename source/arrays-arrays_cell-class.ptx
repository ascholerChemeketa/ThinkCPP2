<title>The Cell Class</title>
<p>
When drawing a cell, we'll need to know its location on the screen and size in pixels.
To represent the location, we use the <c>x</c> and <c>y</c> coordinates of the upper-left corner.
And to represent the size, we use an integer, <c>size</c>.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>state</h></idx>
To represent the state of a cell, we use an integer, <c>state</c>, which is <c>0</c> for dead cells and <c>1</c> for live cells.
We could use a <c>boolean</c> instead, but it's good practice to design classes to be reusable (e.g., for other games that have more states).
</p>

<p>
Here is a <c>Cell</c> class that declares these instance variables:
</p>

<program>
public class Cell {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;
    private final int size;
    private int state;
}
</program>

<p>
Notice that <c>x</c>, <c>y</c>, and <c>size</c> are constants.
Once the cell is created, we don't want it to move or change size.
But <c>state</c> can and should change, so it is not a constant.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to write a constructor.
Here's one that takes <c>x</c>, <c>y</c>, and <c>size</c> as parameters, and sets <c>state</c> to a default value:
</p>

<program>
public Cell(int x, int y, int size) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.size = size;
    this.state = 0;
}
</program>

<p>
The following method draws a cell.
Like the <c>paint</c> method in <xref ref="graphics">Appendix</xref>, it takes a graphics context as a parameter:
</p>

<program>
public static final Color[] COLORS = {Color.WHITE, Color.BLACK};

public void draw(Graphics g) {
    g.setColor(COLORS[state]);
    g.fillRect(x + 1, y + 1, size - 1, size - 1);
    g.setColor(Color.LIGHT_GRAY);
    g.drawRect(x, y, size, size);
}
</program>

<p>
The <c>draw</c> method uses the state of the cell to select a color from an array of <c>Color</c> objects.
Then it uses to <c>fillRect</c> to draw the center of the cell and <c>drawRect</c> to draw a light-gray border.
</p>

<p>
We also need methods to get and set the cell's state.
We could just provide <c>getState</c> and <c>setState</c>, but the code will be more readable if we provide methods customized for the Game of Life:
</p>

<program>
public boolean isOff() {
    return state == 0;
}

public boolean isOn() {
    return state == 1;
}

public void turnOff() {
    state = 0;
}

public void turnOn() {
    state = 1;
}
</program>
