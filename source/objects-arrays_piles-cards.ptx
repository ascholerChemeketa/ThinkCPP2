<title>Piles of Cards</title>
<p>
<idx><h>War (card game)</h></idx>
Now that we have classes that represent cards and decks, let's use them to make a game.
One of the simplest card games that children play is called <q>War</q> (see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)}).
</p>

<p>
Initially, the deck is divided evenly into two piles, one for each player.
During each round, each player takes the top card from their pile and places it, face up, in the center.
Whoever has the highest-ranking card, ignoring suit, takes the two cards and adds them to the bottom of their pile.
The game continues until one player has won the entire deck.
</p>

<p>
We could use the <c>Deck</c> class to represent the individual piles.
However, our implementation of <c>Deck</c> uses a <c>Card</c> array, and the length of an array can't change.
As the game progresses, we need to be able to add and remove cards from the piles.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>ArrayList</h></idx>
<idx><h>collection</h></idx>
We can solve this problem with an <c>ArrayList</c>, which is in the <c>java.util</c> package.
An <c>ArrayList</c> is a <term>collection</term>, which is an object that contains other objects.
It provides functions to add and remove elements, and it grows and shrinks automatically.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>Pile</h></idx>
We define a new class named <c>Pile</c> to represent a pile of cards.
It uses an <c>ArrayList</c> to store <c>Card</c> objects:
</p>

<program xml:id="objects-arrays_piles-cards-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/objects-arrays_piles-cards-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<idx><h>angle brackets</h></idx>
<idx><h>brackets</h><h>angle</h></idx>
<idx><h>\textless\textgreater<nbsp/>angle brackets</h></idx>
When you declare an <c>ArrayList</c>, you specify the type it contains in angle brackets (<c>LESSMORE</c>).
This declaration says that <c>cards</c> is not just an <c>ArrayList</c>; it's an <c>ArrayList</c> of <c>Card</c> objects.
The constructor initializes <c>this.cards</c> with an empty <c>ArrayList</c>.
</p>

<p>
Now let's think about the functions we need to play the game.
At the beginning of each round, each player draws a card from the top of their pile.
So we define a function to do that:
</p>

<program xml:id="objects-arrays_piles-cards-2" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/objects-arrays_piles-cards-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<c>popCard</c> removes the <c>Card</c> at the beginning of the <c>ArrayList</c>, which we think of as the top of the pile.
Because we use <c>ArrayList.remove</c>, it automatically shifts the remaining cards to fill the gap.
</p>

<p>
At the end of each round, the winner adds cards to the bottom of their pile.
So we define a function to do that:
</p>

<program xml:id="objects-arrays_piles-cards-3" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/objects-arrays_piles-cards-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<c>ArrayList</c> provides a function, <c>add</c>, that adds an element to the end of the collection, which we think of as the bottom of the pile.
</p>

<p>
To know when to stop the game, we have to check if one of the piles is empty.
Here's a function to do that:
</p>

<program xml:id="objects-arrays_piles-cards-4" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/objects-arrays_piles-cards-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
So far, these functions don't do very much; they just invoke functions on the instance variable, <c>cards</c>.
functions like these are called <term>wrapper functions</term> because they wrap one function with another.
</p>

<p>
Finally, to start the game, we need to divide the deck into two equal parts.
We can do that with <c>subdeck</c> from <xref ref="subdeck">Section</xref> and a new function, <c>addDeck</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="objects-arrays_piles-cards-5" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/objects-arrays_piles-cards-5.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<c>addDeck</c> takes a <c>Deck</c> object, loops through the cards, and adds them to the <c>Pile</c>.
Notice that it does not remove the cards from the <c>Deck</c>, so the <c>Deck</c> and the <c>Pile</c> share cards.
But that won't be a problem because cards are immutable.
