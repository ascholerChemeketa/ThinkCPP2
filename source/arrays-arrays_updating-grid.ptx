<title>Updating the Grid</title>
<p>
Now we are ready to write <c>update</c>, which gets invoked each time through the simulation loop.
It uses the GoL rules to compute the state of the grid after the next time step:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_updating-grid-1">
<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-arrays_updating-grid-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The rules of GoL specify that you have to update the cells <q>simultaneously</q>; that is, you have to count the neighbors for all cells before you can update any of them.
</p>

<p>
We do that by traversing the grid twice: first, <c>countNeighbors</c> counts the live neighbors for each cell and puts the results in an array named <c>counts</c>; second, <c>updateGrid</c> updates the cells.
Here's <c>countNeighbors</c>:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_updating-grid-2">
<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-arrays_updating-grid-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<c>countNeighbors</c> traverses the cells in the grid and uses <c>countAlive</c> from the previous section to count the neighbors.
The return value is a 2D array of integers with the same size as <c>grid</c>.
<xref ref="fig_countNeigh">Figure</xref> illustrates an example.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_countNeigh" >
<caption>The result of <c>countNeighbors</c> for the grid in <xref ref="conwaymain">Section</xref>.</caption>
<image width="93%" source="images/figure15-6.png" />
</figure>
<p>
In contrast to the <c>draw</c> method of <c>GridCanvas</c>, which uses enhanced <c>for</c> loops, <c>countNeighbors</c> uses standard <c>for</c> loops.
The reason is that, in this example, we need the indexes <c>r</c> and <c>c</c> to store the neighbor counts.
</p>

<p>
<c>updateGrid</c> uses <c>getCell</c> to select each <c>Cell</c> in the grid, and <c>updateCell</c> to do the update:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_updating-grid-3">
<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-arrays_updating-grid-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
<c>updateCell</c> implements the GoL rules: if the cell is alive, it dies if it has fewer than two or more than three neighbors; if the cell is dead, it comes to life if it has exactly three:
</p>

<program xml:id="arrays-arrays_updating-grid-4">
<xi:include href="../programs/arrays-arrays_updating-grid-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Notice that <c>updateGrid</c> and <c>updateCell</c> are both <c>private</c>, because they are helper methods not intended to be invoked from outside the class.
<c>updateCell</c> is also <c>static</c>, because it does not depend on <c>grid</c>.
</p>

<p>
Now our implementation of the Game of Life is complete.
We think it's is pretty fun, and we hope you agree.
But more importantly, this example is meant to demonstrate the use of 2D arrays and an object-oriented design that's a little more substantial than in previous chapters.
