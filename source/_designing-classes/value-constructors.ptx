<title>Value Constructors</title>
<p>
    <idx><h>overload</h></idx>
Like other functions, constructors can be overloaded, which means you can provide multiple constructors with different parameters.
Java knows which constructor to invoke by matching the arguments you provide with the parameters of the constructor.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>value constructor</h></idx>
    <idx><h>constructor</h><h>value</h></idx>
It is common to provide both a <q>default constructor</q> that takes no arguments, like the previous one, and a <q>value constructor</q>, like this one:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/value-constructors-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
To invoke this constructor, you have to provide arguments to the <pf>new</pf> operator.
The following example creates a <pf>Time</pf> object that represents a fraction of a second before noon:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/value-constructors-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Overloading constructors provides the flexibility to create an object first and then fill in the attributes, or collect all the information before creating the object itself.
</p>

<p>
Once you get the hang of it, writing constructors gets boring.
You can write them quickly just by looking at the list of instance variables.
In fact, some IDEs can generate them for you.
</p>

<p>
Here is the complete class definition so far:
</p>

<program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/designing-classes/value-constructors-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
Notice how the second constructor declares the parameters <pf>hour</pf>, <pf>minute</pf>, and <pf>second</pf>.
Java allows you to declare parameters (and local variables) with the same names as instance variables.
They don't have to use the same names, but it's common practice.
</p>

<p>
    <idx><h>shadowing</h></idx>
The right side of <pf>this.hour = hour;</pf> refers to the parameter <pf>hour</pf>, since it was declared most recently.
This situation is called <term>shadowing</term>, because the parameter <q>hides</q> the instance variable with the same name.
</p>

<p>
Java provides the keyword <pf>this</pf> so you can access instance variables, regardless of shadowing.
As a result, this constructor copies the values from the parameters to the instance variables.
