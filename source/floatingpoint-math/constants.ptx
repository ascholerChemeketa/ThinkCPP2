  <title>Literals and Constants</title>

  <p> Although most of the world has adopted the metric system for weights and measures, some
    countries are stuck with imperial units. For example, when talking with friends in Europe about
    the weather, people in the United States might have to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and
    back. Or they might want to convert height in inches to centimeters. We can write a program to
    help: </p>

  <program label="floatingpoint-math_constants-program-1"
           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/literals-constants-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p> This code works correctly, but it has a minor problem. If another programmer reads this code,
    they might wonder where 2.54 comes from. For the benefit of others (and yourself in the future),
    it would be better to assign this value to a variable with a meaningful name. <idx>
      <h>literal</h>
    </idx> A value that appears in a program, like the number 2.54, is called a <term>
    literal</term>. In general, there's nothing wrong with literals. But when numbers like 2.54
    appear in an expression with no explanation, they make the code hard to read. And if the same
    value appears many times and could change in the future, it makes the code hard to maintain. </p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>magic number</h>
    </idx> Values like 2.54 are sometimes called <term>magic numbers</term>
    (with the implication that being magic is not a good thing). A good practice is to assign magic
    numbers to variables with meaningful names, like this: </p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/literals-constants-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>Now it is hopefully a little more clear what we are multiplying <pf>inches by</pf>, but it still has a
    problem. Variables can vary (hence the term), but the number of centimeters in an inch does not.
    Once we assign a value to <pf>cmPerInch</pf>, it should never change.</p>

  <p>C++ provides the keyword <pf>const</pf>, a language feature that enforces this rule. When declaring a
    variable, you can add <pf>const </pf> before the type. This modifies the data type and declares that its
    can't be changed after it is created. Trying to change a <pf>const</pf> value after it is created will
    result in a compile error as seen in this program: <idx>
      <h>const</h>
    </idx>
  </p>

  <program label="floatingpoint-math_constants-program-2" 
           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/literals-constants-3.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <insight>
    <p><pf>const</pf> is not needed to make a program work correctly, but it does help prevent errors. It
      clearly communicates to other programmers that the value should not be changed and asks the
      compiler to enforce that rule. </p>
  </insight>

  <p>Constants are often written in all capital letters to make them stand out. This is a
    convention, not a requirement. The following program demonstrates how many programmers would use
    a const to avoid the magic number 2.54:</p>

  <program label="floatingpoint-math_constants-program-3"
           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/input-output/literals-constants-4.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
