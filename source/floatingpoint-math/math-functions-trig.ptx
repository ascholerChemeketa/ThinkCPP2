  <title>Trigonometric Functions</title>

  <p>At this point, you should take a few minutes to scan the <url href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/cmath">list
    of functions offered in the cmath library</url>. You do not need to memorize them, but it is
    useful to be aware of what is there so you can go look up the exact syntax when you need to do
    some math.</p>

  <p>
    <idx>
      <h>degrees</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>radians</h>
    </idx>
    <idx>
      <h>pi</h>
    </idx> One thing that can cause confusion is the units used for trigonometric
    functions <mdash/> <c>sin</c>, <c>cos</c>, and <c>tan</c>. Angle measurements must be in <term>radians</term>.
    To convert from degrees to radians, you divide by 180 and multiply by <m>\pi</m>. Unfortunately
    C++ does not traditionally provide an approximation for <m>\pi</m> in the cmath library! If you
    need it, you can use the trick that <m>acos(-1) = \pi</m>:</p>

  <program xml:id="floatingpoint-math_math-functions-trig-1">
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/math-functions-trig-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
  </program>

  <p>Similarly, you can convert from radians to degrees by multiplying by 180 and then dividing by <m>\pi</m>. The following program demonstrates this:</p>

  <program xml:id="floatingpoint-math_math-functions-trig-2">
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/math-functions-trig-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
