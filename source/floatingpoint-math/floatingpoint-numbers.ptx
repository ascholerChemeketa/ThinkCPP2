    </idx>So what do you do if you want to divide 45 by 60 and get 0.75? Or if you want to store 3.14159? In C++, the answer is to use <term>floating-point</term> numbers,
    which represent values with decimal places. In C++, the default floating-point type is called <pf>double</pf>,
    which is short for <q>double-precision</q>. You can create <pf>double</pf> variables and assign values
    to them the same way we did for <pf>int</pf>s:</p>

  <program>
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/floatingpoint-numbers-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

  <p>Once we have a <pf>double</pf> variable, we can do math with it. All of the operations work as you would expect:</p>

  <listing>
  <program label="floatingpoint-math_floatingpoint-numbers-program-1"
           interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../../programs/floatingpoint-math/floatingpoint-numbers-2.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>
  </listing>

  <p>When printed, floating point values will be printed rounded to six significant digits. If the value is very large or small, it will be printed in scientific notation like <pf>3.12345E12</pf> indicating <m>3.12345 \times {10}^{12}</m>. (We will learn how to change that formatting later.)</p>

  <note>
  <p>All the operations we have seen<mdash/>addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    and division<mdash/>work on floating-point values, although you might be
    interested to know that the underlying mechanism is completely
    different. In fact, most processors have special hardware just for
    performing floating-point operations. It generally takes longer to perform a given calculation
    using floating point hardware <mdash/> <pf>1/3</pf> is quicker to compute than <pf>1.0/3.0</pf>. That is one of the reasons why we have two different basic numeric types.</p>
