<title>Java Library Source</title>
<p>
<idx><h>library</h></idx>
<idx><h>source code</h></idx>
So far we have used several classes from the Java library, including <c>System</c>, <c>String</c>, <c>Scanner</c>, <c>Math</c>, and <c>Random</c>.
These classes are written in Java, so you can read the source code to see how they work.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>src.zip</h></idx>
The Java library contains thousands of files, many of which are thousands of lines of code.
That's more than one person could read and understand fully, but don't be intimidated!
</p>

<p>
Because it's so large, the library source code is stored in a ZIP archive named <em>src.zip</em>.
If you have Java installed on your computer, you should already have this file somewhere:
<ul>
<li><p>On Linux, it's likely under: <c>/usr/lib/jvm/.../lib</c>

 If not, you might have to install the <em>openjdk-...-source</em> package.</p></li>
<li><p>On macOS, it's likely under: 
 <c>/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/.../Contents/Home/lib</c></p></li>
<li><p>On Windows, it's likely under: <c>C:\Program Files\Java\...\lib</c></p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When you open (or unzip) the file, you will see folders that correspond to Java packages.
For example, open the <em>java</em> folder, and then open the <em>awt</em> folder.
(If you don't see a <em>java</em> folder at first, open the <em>java.desktop</em> folder.)
You should now see <em>Point.java</em> and <em>Rectangle.java</em>, along with the other classes in the <c>java.awt</c> package.
</p>

<p>
Open <em>Point.java</em> in your editor and skim through the file.
It uses language features we haven't discussed yet, so you probably won't understand every line.
But you can get a sense of what professional Java source code looks like by browsing through the library.
</p>

<p>
<idx><h>documentation</h></idx>
<idx><h>HTML</h></idx>
<idx><h>Javadoc</h></idx>
Notice how much of <em>Point.java</em> is documentation (see <xref ref="javadoc">Appendix</xref>).
Each method includes comments and tags like <c>@param</c> and <c>@return</c>.
Javadoc reads these comments and generates documentation in HTML.
You can see the same documentation online by doing a web search for <q>Java Point</q>.
</p>

<p>
Now take a look at the <c>grow</c> and <c>translate</c> methods in the <c>Rectangle</c> class.
There is more to them than you may have expected.
