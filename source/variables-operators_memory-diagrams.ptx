<title>Memory Diagrams</title>
<p>
Because Java uses the <c>=</c> symbol for assignment, it is tempting to interpret the statement <c>a = b</c> as a statement of equality.
It is not!
</p>

<p>
Equality is commutative, and assignment is not.
For example, in mathematics if <m>a = 7</m>, then <m>7 = a</m>.
In Java <c>a = 7;</c> is a legal assignment statement, but <c>7 = a;</c> is not.
The left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name (storage location).
</p>

<p>
Also, in mathematics, a statement of equality is true for all time.
If <m>a = b</m> now, <m>a</m> is always equal to <m>b</m>.
In Java, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don't have to stay that way:
</p>

<program xml:id="variables-operators_memory-diagrams-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/variables-operators_memory-diagrams-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
The third line changes the value of <c>a</c>, but it does not change the value of <c>b</c>, so they are no longer equal.
</p>

Taken together, the variables in a program and their current values make up the program's <em>state</em>.
<xref ref="fig_state">Figure</xref> shows the state of the program after these assignment statements run.
</p>
<figure xml:id="fig_state" >

</figure>

<idx><h>diagram</h><h>memory</h></idx>
Diagrams like this one that show the state of the program are called <em>memory diagrams</em>.
Each variable is represented with a box showing the name of the variable on the outside and its current value inside.
</p>

<p>
As the program runs, the state of memory changes, so memory diagrams show only a particular point in time.
For example, if we added the line <c>int c = 0;</c> to the previous example, the memory diagram would look like <xref ref="fig_state2">Figure</xref>.
