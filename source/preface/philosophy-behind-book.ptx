  <title>The Philosophy Behind the Book</title>
  <p>
    Here are the guiding principles that make the book the way it is: 
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Balance of C++ and concepts:</title>
        <p>The book is not primarily about C++; it uses code examples to demonstrate topics that are
          broadly applicable in programming and computer science. While we attempt to incorporate some important C++ specific features and best practices, this book is not a comprehensive guide to C++.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>One concept at a time:</title>
        <p>This book attempts to focuses on one concept at a time. Although chapters often will depend on material in previous ones, each chapter aims to be self-contained coverage of a particular concept.</p>
