  <title>Acknowledgments</title>
  <p>This book owes its existence to the following works, organizations, and individuals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The structure and significant portions of text for the first 9 chapters, as well as parts
        of chapters 13 and 15, were adapted from the text <url ref="https://github.com/ChrisMayfield/ThinkJavaCode2">Think
        Java, 2nd edition</url> by Allen B. Downey and Chris Mayfield.</p>
      <p>Although this book translates <q>Think Java 2e</q> into a new language, and has significant
        other departures from the original, the early positions of this book are directly based on <q>Think
        Java 2e</q>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>This book started as an attempt to update the version of <q>How to Think Like a Computer
        Scientist: C++ Version</q> that is used by <url ref="https://landing.runestone.academy/">Runestone
        Academy</url>. That book was originally written by Allen B. Downey. The <url ref="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/thinkcpp">Runestone
        version</url> was developed by Barbara Ericson and is currently maintained by Jason Wright.</p>
      <p>Much of the structure and text of that book was abandoned in favor of translating <q>Think
        Java</q>, but many of the interactive exercises that were developed for it were retained and
        adapted for the first 9 chapters of this book.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The interactive features of the book are based on the <url ref="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/">Runestone
        Interactive</url> platform, which provides tools for creating and managing interactive
        educational content. Brad Smith originally developed the platform and serves as its lead developer; it has been enhanced
        by contributions from many others.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The text itself is authored in <url ref="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</url>, a markup
        language for structured documents. PreTeXt was originally developed by Rob Beezer.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Chemeketa Community College provided a sabbatical for Andrew Scholer to work on this project.</li>
  </ul>
