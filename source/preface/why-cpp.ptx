  <title>Why C++?</title>
  <p>
    You are about to embark on learning programming in the C++ language. It is reasonable to ask why
    you should learn C++ when there are so many other programming languages available.
  </p>
  <p>
    C++ is a general-purpose programming language that is used in a wide range of applications. It
    is used for systems programming, embedded systems, games, and other performance-critical
    applications. It is also used for desktop applications, web servers, and other applications
    where performance is important.
  </p>
  <p>
    More importantly, C++ allows you to program in multiple paradigms and think about problems at
    different abstraction levels. Unlike languages like Python or Java, which shield you from
    low-level details, C++ gives you the ability to "look under the hood." This can be beneficial
    for understanding performance implications and writing efficient code. However, C++ also lets
    you work with high-level abstractions that manage these details.</p>
  <p>
    You may have heard that C++ is a difficult language. That can be true, but that difficulty can
    be minimized by learning the language in a structured way and focusing on the subset of the
    language critical for most programming tasks. That is the approach we take in this book.
    One of the areas that remains difficult is the necessity for a C++ programmer to
    clearly specify what they mean. Instead of relying on the language to decide
    the answers to questions like "What type of data is stored here?" and "Does this function
    receive a copy of its parameters or a reference to them?", in C++ you must specify these things
    explicitly. However, in the context of learning to program, being forced to think about these
    questions and specify the answers is a good thing. Later on, if you are programming in a
    language that frees you from these details, you will have a better understanding of what choices
    are being made for you.
