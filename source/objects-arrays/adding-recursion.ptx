<title>Adding Recursion</title>
<p>
To make <c>mergeSort</c> work recursively, you have to add a base case; otherwise, it repeats forever.
The simplest base case is a subdeck with one card.
If there is only one card, it can't be out of order, so we consider it sorted.
And if it is already sorted, we can just return it.
</p>

<p>
And it will turn out to be convenient if we handle another base case, a subdeck with zero cards.
By the same logic, if there are no cards, they can't be out of order.
So we consider an empty deck to be sorted, and return it.
</p>

<p>
With these base cases, a recursive version of <c>mergeSort</c> looks like this:
</p>

<program xml:id="objects-arrays_adding-recursion-1" interactive="activecode">
<xi:include href="../programs/objects-arrays_adding-recursion-1.cpp" parse="text"/>
</program>

<p>
    <idx><h>leap of faith</h></idx>
As usual, there are two ways to think about recursive programs: you can follow the flow of execution, or you can make the <q>leap of faith</q> (see <xref ref="leap_of_faith">Section</xref>).
This example should encourage you to make the leap of faith.
</p>

<p>
When you use <c>selectionSort</c> to sort the subdecks, you don't feel compelled to follow the flow of execution.
You assume it works because you already debugged it.
When you make <c>mergeSort</c> recursive, you just replace one sorting algorithm with another.
There is no reason to read the program differently.
</p>

<p>
Well, almost.
You have to think about the base cases and make sure that you reach them.
But other than that, writing the recursive version should be no problem.
As an exercise at the end of this chapter, you'll have a chance to finish off this example.
