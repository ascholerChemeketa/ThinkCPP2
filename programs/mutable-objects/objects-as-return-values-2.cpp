#include <iostream>

// In C++, you would typically define a Rectangle structure yourself.  The
// following is a basic example, but a full implementation would likely be more
// complex.
struct Rectangle {
    double x, y, width, height;
};

int main() {
    Rectangle box = {0, 0, 100, 200};
    // Example usage
    return 0;
}
